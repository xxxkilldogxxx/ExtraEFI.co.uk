            Ignition? </b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Controlling when the mixture is ignited is very important, 
            as an air fuel mixture takes time to ignite fully after the spark plug fires. 
            It is not an instant conversion from a fuel/air mixture to a gas and it 
            is the conversion that produces the pressure on the piston. In order to 
            ignite the fuel at the right time, so the main explosion (maximum pressure) 
            happens as the piston is just starting it's downwards motion, we need to 
            fire the spark plug before the piston reaches the top of the stroke, <b>Top 
              Dead Centre (TDC)</b> . Ignite it too early and it will cause detonation, 
            too late and the exhaust gases will increase, causing melted valves, etc. 
            A leaner mixture will usually take longer to ignite, so more advance is 
            needed in order to get the maximum performance. A richer mixture will ignite 
            quickly, so it will need less advance. In order to get the maximum power 
            from an engine it's ignition timing needs to be correct, likewise, emissions 
            can be effected a great deal with timing at cruising loads. With a boosted 
            engine the timing is even more critical as the boosted air pressure will 
            be a lot warmer, this means it is easier to ignite. So less advance is needed 
            to stop it firing at the wrong position causing detonation. Too small advance 
            and you'll have very high exhaust gases. So, you see, timing is very important.</font></p>

              <td height="39"><div align="center"><font color="#000000"><b><i>Ignition Advance 
                is measured in degrees of the crank BEFORE the relavent cylinder reaches 
                the top of its stroke (TDC), so the higher the advance the earlier 
                it fires.<br><br>
                It is usually measure using #1 cylinder as the reference. <br><br>
                The crank should have a TDC mark and maybe a few marks to indicate 
                5-10 deg BTDC (Before TDC) and possibly ATDC (After TDC).</i></b></font></div></td>

              <font color="#000000">Generally t</font><font color="#000000">he idle and 
                low speed area's have a lower advance of around 8-20deg, usually idle will 
                be around 8-12deg, but this depends on your engine's design. The cruising 
                area of the engine should have a reasonably high advance, (low to high 30's) 
                as the mixture will be reasonably lean and therefore will give a slower 
                burn. The overrun area can have an even greater advance, this will allow 
                you to run lean in that section. At Wide Open Throttle (WOT) the spark map 
                needs to be RPM based (analogous to centrifugal advance on an old style 
                distributor) coming in at the right rate relative to engine RPM. Typically, 
                you want it &quot;all in&quot; by about 2800-3200 RPMs for a street performance 
                motor. <br><br>
                In the following example (my RV8 engine) we can see that at 100% (WOT) the 
                maximum advance is reached by 2700RPM, as the load reduces (&lt;100%) the 
                advance increases as the mixture will become leaner (14.7AFR) for economy 
                rather than richer (12.5AFR) for power. At idle (40%) the advance is lowered 
                to around 8deg. <font size="2"><b><font size="3">Note: The load in 
                  this graph is Manifold Pressure (MAP) in KPa, so 100KPa = Atmosphere and 
                  anything lower is vacuum. Idle and cruise KPa is around 40%, any lower is 
                  when the engine is on over run. </font> </b></font></font></p>
          <p align="center"><img src="Pix/spark_table.JPG" width="636" height="413"></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b>Note:</b> the optimum amount of total advance is 
            not necessarily the most that doesn't cause detonation. For example, with 
            a modern cylinder head design, you might get maximum power at 32&deg;BTDC, 
            but might not experience any detonation until 38&deg;- 40&deg;. However 
            you will still want the advance to come in as quickly as possible (without 
            knocking) up to 32&deg;. My Rover based V8 produces max power around 30&deg;BTDC 
            at WOT, but even at 36&deg; at WOT, I have no detonation. The only real 
            way to tune the spark map for peak power is to use a rolling road, but normal 
            road tuning can produce some very acceptable results in the real world.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">As the load increase the spark map should have less 
            advance as the mixture will be richer and the chances of detonation will 
            also increase with load. When going into boost (anything above atmospheric 
            pressure) the advance table values will need to be lower than when out of 
            boost and as the boost level increases the advance will need to decrease 
            with it, as detonation is more likely. It has been said that 1deg of advance 
            should be removed for every 2PSI of boost; this is simply a rough guide 
            and lots of things can depend on how much to remove, including compression 
            ratio. Detonation Cans are a great option for tuning in boost, use a piece 
            of copper pipe flattened at one end with a flexible tube connected to it. 
            Bolt the flattened end to the cylinder head. Get an old set of ear defenders 
            and drill a hole into the side of them, push the other end or the tube into 
            the hole you've just drilled in the defenders and you should be able to 
            hear any detonation as it occurs. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Cruising is probably the hardest part of the spark 
            map to tune, shunting in the cruising area is usually down to too much advance, 
            or too weak a mixture. If the mixture is correct (16.0 to 13.5 depending 
            on your cam) then it may be worth removing advance until the shunting subsides. 
            Too little advance will reduce throttle response so don't go too far, too 
            little advance can also create higher exhaust gas temperatures.</font></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b><font size="5">Ignition Hardware</font></b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Ignition control can vary a great deal from one engine 
            to the next in that it can be distributor based, coil pack based (wasted 
            spark), one coil per cylinder (COP) or even 2 plugs per cylinder. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="4"><b><a name="coils"></a>Coils<br><br>
            </b></font><font color="#000000">All the systems discused here use one or 
              more coils. They all work using the same theory, just some have 2 spark 
              plugs permanently connected to the coil, others have one spark plug and 
              some have a distributor to send the HT to the correct cylinder.
              It is a relatively simple device which has 2 windings inside it. The central 
              winding is the <b>Primary</b> and then theres a <b>Secondary</b> winding 
              wound around that. The secondary has 100's of times more windings than the 
              primary, this makes it similar to a 'step up' transformer.<br><br>
              The Primary winding has a 12V ignition feed to it and the other side (-ve) 
              is grounded by the points, amplifier or the ECU. When the -ve side is grounded 
              the coil charges up untill it is saturated (reaches its maximum current) 
              this is know as the <b>dwell time</b>. The -ve side of the primary is then 
              suddenly opened by the points or ECU, etc. As the primary voltage collapes 
              it creates a massive magnetic field that in turn induces a huge voltage 
              to flow into the secondary winding (due to the very large number of turns 
              in the winding). <br>
              This voltage is then sent to the spark plug via the HT lead or distributor, 
              etc. The secondary winding's voltage is searching for a ground, the nearest 
              ground will be on the tip of the spark plug where it will jump across to 
              create a spark. The larger the spark plug gap, the larger the voltage needs 
              to be to jump across it. Modern coil pack systems can easily jump a 1.2mm 
              spark gap.</font></p>

            This will have a single ignition coil (The odd setup may have 2 coils) and 
            a rotor arm that lines up with the HT lead on the distributor cap for the 
            cylinder to be fired during the firing window. </font><font color="#000000">There

            vacuum diaphragm. These weights open up against springs as the rotational 
            inertia gets greater (increase in RPM) making the angle the sensor triggers 
            at change. When the trigger occurs the coil will be fired either directly 
            or via an amplifier, so the angle the spark occurs at is directly controlled 
            by the weights and the vacuum advance. The fact that the angle changes all 
            the time makes it impossible for an ECU to control the firing angle, because 
            the trigger isn't happening at a known constant. So to use these with an 
            ECU the mechanism would have to be locked into a fixed position.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><b><i>ii) Fixed triggering sensor. </i></b>These 
            can have points/hall sensor within the distributor or a sensor that is triggered 
            from the crank or even off a cam sensor, but they do not move around. The 
            sensor is fixed so the angle that it fires at will never change. This means 
            the ECU will have to control the spark angle. (Note: If using a movable 
            triggering sensor then it must be fixed in order to get mappable ignition 
            from a MegaSquirt ECU). The ECU can calculate the engine speed from the 
            trigger inputs and it has a known angle when the sensor triggers so it can 
            calculate how long to leave before it fires the coil, thus changing the 
            firing angle. There will be an internal table that the ECU uses to look 
            up what angle (delay) there needs to be at xxxRPM and engine load. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Most engines will be fired across the angles of 10deg 
            BTDC to around 45deg BTDC, depending on load, etc, this is the firing window. 
            So the rotor arm needs to be big enough to line up with the post in the 
            distributor cap for around 30-35deg, otherwise the coil could fire when 
            it's not lined up causing a cross fire to another cylinder. </font></p>
          <p align="center"><img src="Pix/dizzy_10deg.JPG" width="457" height="349"></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#000000">So with the engine at 10deg BTDC the 
            rotor arm will still be lined up with the post in the cap (e.g. cylinder 
            #1) but it will be on the trailing part of it, as this is the least advanced 
            angle it will probably be needed to fire at. Angles of 35-40 will be lined 
            up with the same post by the leading edge of the rotor:</font></p>
          <p align="center"><img src="Pix/dizzy_40deg.JPG" width="457" height="349"></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#000000">So you can see that the rotor has to 
            be positioned correctly so the correct cylinder is fired across the used 
            firing angle. Older distributor's have weights inside and a vacuum advance 
            to change the angle mechanically. These weights may even alter the rotor 
            arm against a spring. So if you lock it up to use the trigger as a fixed 
            input to the MegaSquirt ECU you must carefully check that the rotor arm 
            has a large enough contact area to cover the firing window. To line it up 
            place the engine around 20-25deg BTDC (in the middle of the firing window) 
            and line the center of the rotor arm up to the correct post. You may have 
            to phase the distributor to do this.</font></p>

            have 3 coils, a V8 will have 4 coils, etc. Each coil will fire 2 spark plugs, 
            the cylinder on its compression stroke and its firing order opposite cylinder

          <p align="left"><font color="#000000">This style of firing can only be used 
            on an evenly spaced crank, which is 99% of engines. So on an odd fire setup 
            this won't work as there would be no piston opposite to the one on the compression 
            stroke.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#000000">The ECU needs a fixed trigger input 
            from either the cam using a Cam Angle Sensor (CAS) or a sensor on the crank. 
            The signal pattern varies enormously from one manufacturer to another, but 
            for a wasted spark setup it will need to have at least the same amount of 
            triggers off the crank as the number of cylinders the engine has. It will 
            also need some form of a reference pulse or missing tooth so it knows where 
            the crank angle is. So take for instance a Ford 36-1 crank wheel. This has 
            space for 36 teeth (one every 10deg apart) and it has one tooth missing 
            (36-1) so the missing tooth is the reference for the ECU. It can then count 
            the teeth from when it notices the missing one, giving it the exact angle 
            where the crank is at any given time. So if the missing tooth lines up with 
            the sensor at 90deg BTDC, then when it counts to 5 teeth from the missing 
            one the engine will be 40deg BTDC (5 teeth at 10deg apart = 50deg - 90deg 
            = 40deg). So the ECU can use the pattern to calculate when to fire the coils. 
            As a wasted spark format is repeated every CRANK revolution, theres no need 
            for a cam signal, but a cam signal can still be used as it rotates at half 
            the speed of the crank.</font></p>

            Plug (COP)</font></b></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Like the coil pack setup, this has no distributor, 
            instead it has one ignition coil per spark plug. This setup can sequentially 
            fire the cylinders if theres a cam signal or it can fire in a wasted spark 
            format as <a href="#wasted">above</a>. The ECU needs a fixed trigger input 
            from either the cam using a Cam Angle Sensor (CAS) or a sensor on the crank. 
            The signal pattern varies enormously from one manufacturer to another, but 
            for a sequentially fired setup it will need to have a pattern that includes 
            a reference pulse or missing tooth pattern from the cam (as the cam timing 
            starts the firing sequence over again). Like the wasted spark setup, the 
            ECU calculates the angle to fire from the crank/cam pattern. It knows which 
            cylinder to fire as it will use the cam signal to reset the sequence, so 
            once it detects the cam is at the correct angle it will know what cylinder 
            to fire to start the sequence off and it can calculate the angle to fire 
            it at from the other pulses it receives. These other pulses can come from 
            the cam or the crank, but the reset signal will be from the cam. </font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000">Some COP's have built in ignitors, this means the 
            ECU simply sends a signal to the COP and the COP has a built in amplifier 
            to fire it's own coil. Older COPs are simply a coil that the ECU will drive 
            or there may be an external ignitor/amplifier. For more on COP's click <a href="cop_ignitor.htm">here</a>.</font></p>
