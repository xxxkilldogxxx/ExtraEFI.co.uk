                    that there's far too much information on the internet about MegaSquirt 
                    products and its all too confusing or just too much to take in. 
                    I have to agree, despite my website being crammed full of info, there's 
                    not enough specific to what's needed to get running and too much on 
                    products, versions, boards, etc, etc. So I hope this page will help 
                    some people cut through it all a little easier. I've also got a glossary 
                    of terms <a href="glossary.htm">HERE</a> for people who are not familiar 
                    with EFI, etc. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">The following is all 
                    strictly my opinion and other people may have different views:</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000"><em><font color="#CCCCCC">It is easiest to think of the ECU as two items, <strong>MS1, MS2 or MS3</strong> (which is the processor thats used) and also the <strong>Version of the board</strong>, which is where the processor  plugs into.</font></em></font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000"><b>First a little history 
                    (sorry, I know it's boring but it does help with how we got here). </b><br><br>
                    Bruce and Al (thats B+G, the 2 people who own MegaSquirt) produced 
                    the first real MegaSquirt around 2002 time. This is known as<b> MS1 </b>and this microprocessor could be run on a PCB called the V2.2, 
                    also produced by B+G.<br><br>
                    Then James and I got involved and we came up with the <strong>MS1-Extra</strong> code, 
                    this took us a few years to develop up to the current and last code 
                    which is version <a href="downloads.htm">029y4</a>. This could be 
                    run on an MS1 microprocessor with a V2.2 board, then in 2005 the V3.0 
                    board was produced, which again could run the <strong>MS1-Extra</strong> code on it 
                    with the MS1 microprocessor. The MS1 can also be run on the V3.57 board, 
                    but more on the boards later. The big advantage for using the<strong> MS1-Extra</strong> code over the original B+G code for MS1, 
                    was that it gave you 12x12 tuning tables for fuel, 8x8 for ignition 
                    and up to 6 spark outputs (so anything up to a V12 could be controlled 
                    with ignition and fuel!!) where as the standard MS1 with the B+G code had an 8x8 fuel table and no ignition. Another major step forward was wheel decoding, this 
                    means it can read standard pulses from lots of different engines, 
                    e.g. the Ford 36-1, Bosch 60-2, etc. The Extra code also gave you 
                    things like launch control, rev limiters, boost control, PWM idle 
                    control, knock control, etc, etc , etc! None of this was possible 
                    with the MS1 basic code, so if you go for an MS1 then it has to have 
                    the <strong>MS1-Extra</strong> code running it if you want your car to work. This is 
                    easy to do and costs nothing. It is my opinion that you should ignore 
                    the other code and just put Extra in it from the start, this way you 
                    should be running quicker. I've never sold an ECU that needed the 
                    original code in it, all have been sold with <strong>MS-Extra</strong>, all my <a href="support.htm">Help 
                      files</a> are setup for <strong>MS-Extra</strong> and all my <a href="MS_All_products.htm">ECU's</a> are loaded and configured ready for your engine with <strong>MS-Extra</strong>.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Anyhow, back to the history 
                    lesson. A few years later <b>MS2</b> was brought out by Bruce and 
                    Al, basically this was a daughter board that replaced the MS1 processor 
                    on the V2.2, V3.0 or V3.57 board. This daughter board has CAN capability, 
                    a faster processor, more memory and the ability to drive a stepper 
                    motor idle vavle. Despite this the MS1 processor using the<strong> MS1-Extra</strong> code was still the most 
                    popular ECU as it could run far more engines than MS2 could, mainly 
                    due to MS2 (B+G) only being able to control one (may have been two, 
                    I can't remember) spark output(s). So people still tended to go for 
                    an MS1, with <strong>MS1-Extra</strong> code. The <strong>MS1-Extra</strong> code had now got as far 
                    as it could, <a href="downloads.htm">(version 029y4)</a>, so I concentrated 
                    on writting the <a href="http://www.msextra.com/manuals/MS_Extra_Manual_Index.htm" target="_parent">MS1-Extra 
                      Manuals</a>, making it easier for people to use and run the code, 
                    whilst James teamed up with Ken and started to put the Extra features 
                    from<strong> MS1-Extra</strong> into the base MS2 code from B+G. This code is known 
                    as <strong>MS2-Extra</strong> and slowly it has become more popular. It has more features 
                    than <strong>MS1-Extra</strong> and can decode a lot more standard crank/cam wheels. 
                    Again, it is my opinion that all MS2's should just start with the <a href="downloads.htm">MS2-Extra code</a>, as you will be up and 
                    running quicker. Just like my <a href="MS_All_products.htm">MS1 ECU's</a>, 
                    all my <a href="MS_All_products.htm">MS2 ECU's</a> come with <strong>MS2-Extra</strong> loaded into them and all my <a href="support.htm">Help pages</a> are 
                    for the Extra code.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Now the <strong>MS3</strong> has been released we have another option to throw into the mix. The real difference with this is that Bruce and Al left it to the Extra team to do the code from the start, so there will not be a B+G version then an Extra version. Again, it is a daughter board that plugs into the main board, so its upgradeable from <strong>MS1</strong> or<strong> MS2</strong>. This has an expansion board that can go with it, called an <strong>MS3X </strong>card, this has lots of built in outputs and inputs ready to use on features like launch control, boost, etc, so they don't need building onto the main board like the MS1-Extra and MS2-Extra ECUs have</font>. <font color="#000000">For more on the<strong> MS3X</strong> see <a href="MS3X_board.html"><strong>HERE</strong></a></font>.</p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000"><b><font size="4">So what about all 
                    the boards, V2.2, V3.0, V3.57, then there's MicroSquirt's, PnP and 
                    all sorts of other things:</font></b><br><br>
              <b><font size="4">V2.2</font></b><br>V2.2 is really obsolete now, it can't do ignition control easily 
                    (EDIS is OK), it has no VR conditioner on it, so running 36-1 or 60-2, 
                    etc, isn't possible without adding a board to it. These are fine for 
                    EDIS based setups where no inputs or outputs are needed for knock, 
                    boost, tacho, etc. It also can't control low impedance injectors without another board being added to it and it doesn't have such a high noise immune power circuit like the V3.0 board does. There is, however, a built in MAP sensor that can cope with up to 21psi as standard or can be upgraded to 38psi, but this i the same as a V3.0 board. I just wouldn't bother with them as you will soon 
                    out grow it and want more. Reselling them is also hard as most people 
                    want more from an ECU than these can give, so prices do seem to be 
                    low for these.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000"><b><font size="4">V3.57</font></b><br>V3.57 is a copy of the V3.0 but using surface mounted 
                    components, but it is a nightmare to add things to as it has no area 
                    for soldering components needed for items like launch control, tacho, 
                    knock, etc, unlike the V3.0. There is a built in MAP sensor that can cope with up to 21psi as standard or can be upgraded to 38psi. The components are very small, so soldering 
                    wires onto them is also very tricky to say the least, so why bother, 
                    when the V3.0 is such a good board and easily fixed if it all goes 
                    wrong!  After all, the V3.57 is simply a copy of the V3.0 with some 
                    stuff missing.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000"><b><font size="4">MicroSquirt's</font></b><br>These all run MS2 processors and it can't use an MS1 or an MS3 processor (so can run <strong>MS2-Extra code</strong>). Again they are 
                    limited to what you can do to them, they do have 2 VR inputs, which 
                    is handy for cam/crank signals, but then they only have 2 spark outputs. So the second input (cam input) can't really be used for sequential 
                    spark with only 2 drivers, as 2 coils is all it can fire without external ignitors, meaning 4cy wasted is the best it can do. It also can't run low-impedance injectors, as it has no peak and hold circuit. The max injector current is 5A per channel, so 4 x hi impedance injectors/bank is the limit. 
                    It has no  Idle valve output in either PWM form or stepper motor form and it can't be upgraded to an MS3. If you want to use any high powered outputs like 
                    tacho, idle, boost control, cooling fan, you'll need to add boards 
                    to it, making it bigger. It also has no built in MAP sensor, so you can't run Speed Density  without adding a MAP sensor externally, which means you can only run Alpha_N.<br>
                    The MicroSquirt is very small, a standard MS1 or MS2 ECU is 180x105x45mm, a MicroSquirt is approx 61x89x45mm, so it's  my opinion that these are best suited 
                    for motorbike's with up to 4 cylinder engines, where space is limited. It's intended us is for odd fire 2 or 4 cylinder engines, e.g. Harley, Ducati, etc.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000"><b><font size="4">V3.0: </font></b><br>It is my opinion that the V3.0 board is still the main 
                    board to use, it is easy to fix if it goes wrong (which is rare) it 
                    has a built in VR conditioner so can be used with 36-1, 60-2, etc, 
                    it can easily be modified to run 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more spark outputs. 
                    It can drive high or low impedance injectors, it is compatable with<strong> MS1-Extra, MS2-Extra</strong> and <strong>MS3</strong>. It has an area for adding components for extra's like 
                    tacho, launch, knock, etc and the MS-Extra manuals are written around 
                    it. There is a built in MAP sensor that can cope with up to 21psi as standard or can be upgraded to 38psi. It's also the only board I've used since 2005 in my MS1 and MS2 
                    ECU's. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">So there you have it,
