                <div align="left"><font color="#000000"><p>There can be a lot of mystery surrounding 
                  the world of Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI), but it's actually quite a straight 
                  forward system if broken down to it's basic components. First off lets consider 
                  the hardware side of things:</p></font>
                    <p><font color="#000000" size="5"><b>EFI Hardware</b></font></p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="Drawings/fuel_basic_hardware.JPG" width="928" height="569"></p>
                </div>
                <blockquote>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">The High Pressure Fuel Pump is usually 
                    gravity fed with fuel as an inline pump or immersed in the fuel inside the 
                    fuel tank. This creates enough fuel pressure so the injectors spray fuel 
                    (helping it to atomize) when they open rather than a dribble of fuel. Pressure 
                    in the system can vary from manufacturers but 36psi - 55 psi is roughly 
                    correct. 43 psi is most the most common pressure. The fuel pressure is actually 
                    controlled by the Fuel Pressure Regulator, the fuel pump supplies enough 
                    fuel under pressure for the regulator to maintain the pressure smoothly. 
                    The regulator has a pressure reference pipe attached to the manifold so 
                    it sees manifold pressure (MAP) this is to keep the pressure across the 
                    injectors at a constant. So if you consider that one end of the injector 
                    will be attached to the manifold it will see manifold pressure. So when 
                    it opens the fuel inside it will see fuel pressure from the fuel pressure 
                    regulator and manifold pressure. As there will be a vacuum in the manifold 
                    the pressure across the injector will be greater than the fuel pressure. 
                    So the fuel pressure is controlled by the regulator. As manifold vacuum 
                    increases to maintain a constant fuel pressure across the injector. This 
                    is important for the ECU, as it needs a constant pressure to ensure that 
                    any given opening time will allow the same amount of fuel to flow under 
                    all conditions:</font></p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="Drawings/reg_injector.JPG" width="743" height="434"></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">The Fuel Return Line is not under pressure, 
                    it is simply the excess fuel that the pump has supplied that the regulator 
                    didn't need to maintain its required pressure. Some Fuel Rails are large 
                    in diameter and are there to hold an amount of fuel inside so that when 
                    the injectors open there's enough fuel to feed them and to keep the pressure 
                    from falling, it's like a buffer.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">The fuel tank can have an integral pre-filter 
                    and sometimes an integral pump. If the fuel tank is from a carb engine (not 
                    EFI) then you'll need to fit a Swirl Pot and a low pressure fuel pump (low 
                    pressure fuel pumps are usually fitted to carb setups), as during cornering 
                    or low fuel levels the fuel line out of the tank may not be in the fuel. 
                    This causes air to enter the fuel line and the injectors will fire air bubbles 
                    at the cylinders rather than fuel, this is felt by a miss fire. Swirl Pots 
                    are available from local manufactures or can be specially made, etc.</font><br>

                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">So that is the basics of the hardware, 
                    next are the sensors for the ECU (Engine Control Unit / Engine Management 
                    Unit, or what ever you wish to call it.) For fuel control we need to know 
                    what the incoming air temperature is, what the engine temperature is, what 
                    the throttle is doing and what the manifold pressure is. Its also handy 
                    to know what the Air to Fuel ratio from the exhaust is reading (AFR) as 
                    this tells us a great deal about how efficient we are running. To tell us 
                    this we need:</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b><font size="4">Intake Air Temperature 
                    Sensor (IAT)</font></b><font size="4"> </font><br>This sensor changes resistance 
                    with temperature (increase in temperature - decreases resistance) and the 
                    ECU uses the information to calculate the density of the incoming air (air 
                    density changes with temperature and pressure). The calculations are fixed 
                    internally so there's little to worry about, but it ensures that that the 
                    ECU supplies the correct fueling across all incoming air temperatures. So 
                    as the temperature increases, air is less dense, the fueling will decrease 
                    to maintain the same AFR and visa-versa for a drop in temperature. Some 
                    ECU's also reduce ignition advance under load if the air temperature gets 
                    too high, this is due to detonation being more likely at higher intake temps. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b><font size="4">Coolant Temperature 
                    Sensor (CLT)</font></b><font size="4"> </font><br>This sensor changes resistance 
                    with temperature (increase in temperature - decreases resistance), the ECU 
                    uses the information to add extra fuel (Warmup Enrichment) when the engine 
                    isn't up to operating temperature, as a cold engine will need a richer mixture 
                    to keep it running smoothly. The ECU also uses the coolant sensor as information 
                    to control the idle valve to allow a little more air in so as to increase 
                    the idle RPM whilst the engine is cold. Some ECU's add some ignition advance 
                    when the engine is colder as this aids warmup times and keeps the engine 
                    running a little faster at idle.(A cold engine is less likely to detonate 
                    so a little advance won't hurt) </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b><font size="4">Throttle Position 
                    Sensor (TPS)</font></b> <br>This is basically a 3 pinned sensor which gives 
                    a variable voltage out as the throttle angle changes. It has 5V to one side 
                    of it, ground to the other and the output pin increases from approx. 0V 
                    to approx. 5V as the throttle angle increases. If you have individual throttle 
                    bodies or a very lumpy cam then this is used to tell the ECU what load the 
                    engine is under, but with a plenum and a single throttle intake usually 
                    this is only needed to tell the ECU that you have suddenly pressed the throttle 
                    and it needs to squirt some extra fuel in to compensate &quot;Accel Enrichment&quot;. 
                    This is also used by the ECU to tell that your foot is on the floor during 
                    cranking, this means that the ECU goes into &quot;Flood Clear&quot; mode 
                    so it doesn't squirt any fuel during cranking to clear a flooded engine.</font></p>

                    Sensor (MAP)</font></b><br>This sensor is built into the MegaSquirt ECU, 
                    it tells the ECU what load the engine is under. The manifold will generally 
                    be under vacuum, the larger the vacuum the less load the engine is under. 
                    Once it reaches atmospheric pressure (on a NA engine) this means the engine 
                    is taking in as much air as it can so it is under maximum load. Any boost 
                    is detected by the MAP sensor too, so again, this is load related, the more 
                    boost pressure the larger the load on the engine. Some engines use a Manifold 
                    Air Flow Meter (MAF), this basically detects air flow into the engine and 
                    is used to tell the ECU the load on the engine, MegaSquirt can use this 
                    but it isn't recommended, we recommend using the built in MAP sensor and 
                    throwing the MAF sensor away if you have one. In MegaSquirt we measure the 
                    MAP in KPa, approx. 100KPa = atmosphere (depending on height above sea level), 
                    anything lower is a vacuum. Anything higher that atmosphere (100KPa) is 
                    boost. Out of interest 6.8KPa = 1PSI, so 168KPa would be 68KPa above atmosphere 
                    so 68 / 6.8 = 10PSI of boost.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b><font size="4">Lambda Sensor (O2)</font></b><br>This tells the ECU what the mixture is in the exhaust. This information 
                    is used by the ECU to fine tune the fueling a little from the base fuel 
                    map. (Generally it can only alter the mixture by approx. 10%) If using a 
                    narrow band sensor (this is a standard type) then the only real information 
                    the sensor gives is that the engine is running lean or rich of stoichiometric 
                    (14.7 parts of Air to 1 part of Fuel AFR). The ECU doesn't know exactly 
                    how far away from 14.7AFR or what the actual AFR is, just that its rich 
                    or lean of that point, so if it is rich it will reduce the fuel by a little 
                    and check again, if its still rich it removes a little more fuel and checks 
                    again, etc, etc until it becomes lean of 14.7 and it will then increase 
                    fuel a little and check again, etc. This closed loop operation usually only 
                    operates at light loads where efficiency is important. When using a Wideband 
                    Lambda sensor (such as an Innovates LC-1) the signal from the lambda controller 
                    to the ECU relates to the actual AFR (not just 14.7), so the ECU will know 
                    exactly what the mixture is doing. This allows the mixture to be controlled 
                    a little better under heavier loads where an AFR of 12.5 - 13.0 is needed 
                    to produce maximum power, a narrow band lambda simply would not be of any 
                    use at this AFR so the ECU would not be adjusting the mixture under load.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b><font size="4">Fuel Injectors</font></b><br>These are opened by the ECU to add fuel to the cylinders, the longer they 
                    are opened for, the more fuel is added. As explained above, the fuel pressure 
                    is regulated so if a pulse of say 1.5mS is applied to the injector the same 
                    amount of fuel flows from the injector under all load conditions. An injector 
                    is rated by its flow in either lbs/hr or cc/min, this is usually measured 
                    with a fuel pressure of 43PSI.<br><br>
          <b><font size="4">1 lb/hr ~ 10.5cc/min</font></b><br>
                    </font><font color="#000000">Don't think that you simply select the biggest 
                      injectors you can find, as this would be wrong. If an injector is selected 
                      that is too big you wont get a good steady idle or a steady cruise, as a 
                      small increase in the pulse sent to the injector from the ECU will have 
                      a large change in fuel. It then becomes difficult to control the AFR making 
                      for a lumpy idle and cruise, and it can be difficult if not impossible to 
                      get through emission testing. The injector is basically a solenoid which 
                      has 12V ignition feed to one side of it and the ECU switches the other side 
                      to ground in order for it to make it open and therefore fuel flow through 
                      it. There is no positive or negative to an injector so they can be connected 
                      either way round, but it's a good idea to keep all of them wired the same 
                      on your setup to aid fault finding, etc.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b>A rough guide to selecting injectors 
                    is:</b><br><br>
          <b><font size="4">InjectorSize = (HorsePower * BSFC) / (#Injectors * DutyCycle) </font></b><br>
                    BSFC = brake specific fuel consumption. This is usually between 0.42 and 
                    0.58 at wide open throttle. Normally aspirated engines with efficient combustion 
                    processes are at the lower end of the BSFC scale ~0.45, where as a supercharged 
                    engine tend to be towards the higher end ~0.55.<br>
                    Duty Cycle is the amount of time the injector is opened when compared to 
                    the amount of time it has available to fire between engine cycles. A max 
                    duty cycle of 85% is highly recommended, 100% is the absolute maximum, but 
                    is not recommended as you are at the very limit of your fueling, don't feel 
                    you can cheat this, you can't!<br>
                    If your not sure then select a set of injectors from an engine that has 
                    the same amount of cylinders you have and that produces a similar amount 
                    of BHP.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Selecting the correct size injectors 
                    isn't as hard as you may think. If you already have an EFI setup then simply 
                    retain those unless you are about to increase the BHP dramatically. Don't 
                    think that you can simply increase fuel pressure to increase your injectors 
                    flow rate, as there is a limit that your pump and pipes and injectors can 
                    take. Also fuel flow doesn't increase at the same rate as pressure, flow 
                    increases at the square root of increase of fuel pressure, so you'll need 
                    a massive increase in fuel pressure to gain much from an injector. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b>Pulse Width (PW)</b> - The length 
                    of time the ECU holds the injector to ground is known as the Pulse Width 
                    (PW). So the longer the PW (time the injector is held open in mSec) the 
                    more fuel flows. <br>
                  </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</b> -<b> </b>Injectors are also put into 2 categories, Low-Impedance and Hi-Impedance. <b><br><br>
                    Lo-Impedance &lt; 3 Ohms<br><br>
                    Hi-Impedance approx. 10-15 Ohms </b><br><br>
                    A lo-Impedance injector will need some adjusting of the Pulse Width Modulation 
                    (PWM) to stop it burning out, where as a Hi-Impedance injectors needs no 
                    such control. Another way around it is to add a series resistor in line 
                    with each lo-impedance injector, making them hi-impedance. <br>
                    To understand what PWM is we need to concider that the injector is switched 
                    on and off very very fast, so fast, in fact, that the injector doesn't shut, 
                    it just has no current flowing through it for a few uSecs. This allows the 
                    time current flows through it to be limitted, stopping it burning out. The 
                    injectors are opened initially with a longer time pulse, Injector Opening 
                    Threshold, then they are maintained open with pulses untill its time to 
                    shut them. (i.e. the PW time ends)<br><br>
          <i><b>Note: A hi-impedance injector is simply turned on at the start of 
            the PW and then off at the end, so the PWM would be 100%.</b></i></font></p>
