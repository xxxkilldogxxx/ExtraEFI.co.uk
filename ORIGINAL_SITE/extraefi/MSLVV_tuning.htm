                        Adjustments made in Tuner Studio are only sent to the ECU if you press 
                            the &quot;TAB <font size="4">button&quot; 
                              on your keyboard after making the change!! (This doesn't apply when 
                              tuning the maps in 3D mode).<br>
                            <br>
                              In order to keep changes ensure you select "BURN TO ECU", this then 
                              sends the adjustments into the permanent memory of the ECU! <br>
                              <br>
                              I find the best method to make adjustments is to alter the value 
                              then press the TAB Button, this ensures they are sent. If the change 
                              is OK click "BURN TO ECU", check it has been sent by clicking "FETCH 
                            FROM ECU". You'll soon get the hang of it.</font></p>

                    to understand that if the engine doesn't start or fire at all then it 
                    is NOT the VE Table (fuel map) that needs tuning, so don't go off and 
                    adjust that as yet. The ONLY fuel that goes into the engine during cranking 
                    is set by the <strong>Startup/Idle</strong> - <b>Cranking Pulse</b>, so if it doesn't fire you will need 
                    to look at the <b>Cranking Pulse</b>. Once it fires and the RPM goes above 
                    approx 300RPM then the VE table is used by the ECU. <br>
    <br>
                    <b>Start with this 
                    Check List:</b></font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000000">&#149;</font>Set the Req_Fuel value in Tuner Studio. This is a basic calculation thats used to keep the VE table values real, rather than too high or too low, therefore giving a good resolution to the adjustments. <br>
                  To do this simply enter your Engine Size, number of cylinders and the injector flow rate (of a single injector) into the Wizard, keep the Air-Fuel to 14.7 unless running another type of fuel. <br>

                  <p><font color="#000000">&#149; Always check timing at cranking before 
                    getting too carried away with fuel. If the sparks don't come at the 
                    right time then it won't start, so check it's firing with a strobe at 
                    approx 10deg BTDC during cranking. If it doesn't, fix that first by 
                    checking/adjusting </font> the &quot;<strong>Tooth #1 Angle</strong>&quot; value in <strong>Ignition Options Wheel Decoder </strong>if using a trigger wheel, or <font color="#000000"> twisting the dizzy, checking alignment of crank/cam sensors, etc.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000000"> &#149; Check that you have an RPM reading during 
                    cranking on the tuning software screen, it needs to be reasonably steady and 
                    around 100-300RPM, if you have no RPM reading then you have a trigger 
                    problem, the ECU is not seeing your hall sensor or VR sensor, etc. If 
                    this is the case then you need to check your wiring to the VR or hall 
                    sensor (the clear or red cable in the screen wire is the signal, the blue or 
                    black is the ground, <i>do NOT connect these together!</i>). If using 
                    a VR sensor you may have to adjust the potentiometers inside the MS 
                    ECU, see <a href="vr_setup.htm">http://www.extraefi.co.uk/vr_setup.htm</a> for instructions. If you have a hall sensor it needs a 5V or 12V ignition 
                    supply, you will need to check what type of sensor you have and see 
                    how it was wired in the original setup. </font></p>

                      time then it is recommended to adjust the <b>REQ_FUEL</b> (in the Engine 
                      Constants page) to richen or lean the engine until it is warm, an increase 
                      in REQ_FUEL richens the mixture across the whole map, a decrease in 
                      it leans the mixture. <b>(Note: Press the TAB button and then press 
                        "BURN TO ECU" to force your settings into the ECU) </b>We recommend using 
                      the REQ_FUEL because you can then re-tune your VE table to keep it all 
                      smooth for a good starting point, if you adjusted the VE table to keep 
                      it running then the chances are your idle areas would be either very 
                      high or very low compared to the rest of the map. Once you have the 
                      engine warm you can set the REQ_FUEL back to the calculated or original 
                      value, BUT you then will need to reset your VE table to compensate. 
                      (Basically the REQ_FUEL increases/decreases fuel over the entire map, 
                      so when you reset it you will need to change the VE table so the same 
                      amount of fuel is added.) To do this, ensure the ECU is powered up but 
                      engine is not running. Remember what the REQ_FUEL value is for a reasonable 
                      idle (in other words what the value ended up being while you were adjusting 
                      it to get it to run OK for the first time), then change the REQ_FUEL 
                      back to where it should. <br>
                    Perform this calculation <strong>Good AFR Req_Fuel</strong> <span class="style42">(at nice AFR)</span> <strong><span class="style43">/</span> Correct Req_Fuel</strong></font><span class="style42"> (calculated)</span> <span class="style45">=</span> <strong>Multiplier</strong><span class="style42"> (value to multiply the VE table)</span><br>
                    e.g. To run it at a good AFR the Req_fuel was 20 but it was calculated at 16.5<br>
                    So 20/16.5 = 1.21</p>
                    <p><font color="#000000"><img src="Pix/VEAdjust.png" alt="" width="852" height="556"></font></p>
                    <p>Next highlight the whole VE table by going to the top left corner and holding the left mouse button down, go down to the opposite corner of the table. It will turn a blue colour.<br>
                    Now click on the<strong> &quot;*&quot;</strong> button and enter 1.21 <br>
                    You will see the whole table is increased by 21% (*1.21)<br>
                    Click <strong>BURN</strong> and now the engine will run at the same AFR but with the req_fuel as it should be (16.5 for example)</p>
                    <p>Once the engine is warm its a good idea to double check the timing, it should have been checked the first time you cranked it over, but as cranking timing can be erratic it is now the best time to check it again to make sure it is accurate. Go into <strong>Ignition Options / Wheel Decoder </strong>and set the <strong>Fixed Timing to Fixed Advance</strong>, this ensures the ECU will give a steady timing angle so you can check it with a strobe. Double check the actual timing on the crank wheel (using a strobe) is correct to the angle youve set (e.g. 12deg) if not alter the <strong>&quot;Tooth #1 Angle&quot; (trigger wheel) </strong> or <strong>Trigger Angle Offset, </strong>twist the dizzy, etc, however the trigger inputs come in to the ECU from the engine config you have.</p>
                  <h2>Warmup Enrichments:</h2><br>
                      Once you have the idle tuned at the engines operating temperature, don't 
                      touch it again while the engine is cold!! Only adjust the <strong>Warmup Enrichments</strong> to get a nice idle/running engine when the engine is cold. This enrichment 
                      is basically additional fueing thats added on top of the fuel map (VE 
                      Table) to richen the mixture when the engine is cold. 100% would mean 
                      it uses the fuel map, 110% means it adds 10% to the fuel map, etc. So 
                      next time you start it from cold get ready on the warmup enrichments 
                      page. These will need tuning for your car, a good base setting is below.</p>
                      <p align="center"><font color="#000000"><img src="Drawings/Warmup_Values.png" width="260" height="465"></font></p><br>
                    <h2>After Start Enrichment:</h2><br>
                      Once the engine fires up from cold keep it running using the throttle and warmup values as above, once your happy with this tune (it will take several days to get this right as the engine needs to be stone cold) and the engine starts from cold and runs smoothly up to operating temp then you can start with <strong>After Start Enrichment</strong>. This is added for a short period of time just after the engine starts, (defined by engine RPM greater than the  setting in &quot;<strong>Cranking Settings</strong>&quot; typically 300RPM), the engine starts to use the VE Table's fuel map and if the coolant is under 71C (170F) it goes into afterstart enrichment. The afterstart enrichment is generally set to increase the percentage of the fueling map it will run at for a pre-determined amount of time or ignition pulses so the engine has a chance to start and smoothen out. This can be set to a different value depending on the coolant temperature in <strong>&quot;After Start Enrichment Settings</strong>&quot; Start out at a user-defined percentage enrichment value (typically around 25%), and then it ramps down to 0% after so many ignition trigger events, which is user-defined (use about 200 for this number to start). This is an enrichment above the normal warm-up enrichment, which is temperature dependent. Please note that 0% means that it will run exactly what the VE table values are and 50% would mean 50% increase over the VE table.</p>
                    <p align="center"><img src="Drawings/ASE_Values.png" width="670" height="470"></p>
                    <p><font color="#000000">If the engine starts and runs for a few seconds, then stalls, this is usually a sign that the afterstart enrichment isn't quite right.  Leave everything else the same, and adjust the Afterstart % and number of cycles. 20% to 30% and 200 cycles are reasonable starting points for most engines, but yours may run better with more or less. There should be a point at which it works without stalling.</font></p>
                    <p><font color="#000000">If the engine starts and runs for more than 20 seconds or so, then stalls, you need to adjust your warm-up enrichment bins. As you adjust your warm-up bins, you may need to re-adjust the afterstart, since these interact (i.e., a larger warm-up value may require a shorter or smaller afterstart enrichment).</font></p>
                    <p><font color="#000000">It's been found that during winter the cranking and after start enrichments need tweaking in order to get the engine to start and run without restarting it several times from cold. The reason is felt that the after start and cranking enrichments don't necessarily follow temperature in a linear format. You can therefore select CLT -  MAT or an average of the two for the Cranking PW to reference.<BR>
                          <BR>
                      After Start Enrich Counter is the length of time in Seconds or engine cycles that the after start enrich runs for. The percentage added is decayed down to zero as the time expires</font></p>

            This is roughly where I would tune a modern engine:</font>            
            <p align="center"><font color="#000000"><img src="Pix/AFR_Table.png" alt="" width="775" height="585"></font>            
            <p align="center"><font color="#000000">The higher load (above 80KPa) is rich for power, some engines like this around 12.5 (older engines), others around 13AFR. As you can see this example (above) is for a Non Boosted engine as it only goes to 100KPa (atmosphere) <br>
            The cruise area of the map (1400rpm to 3000ish / 40KPa - 55 this depends on where your engine runs during cruising) can be leaner, especially if you add some advance around this area. <br>
            The over run area (30KPa) on this map runs a little richer that 14.7 so as to add some fuel, aiding cooling (especially important on a boosted engine) and in this case it creates some popping in the exhaust that sounds great. <br>
            Below is a boosted AFR target table, this runs a little richer in boost to aid with cylinder cooling. There are no hard and fast rules here, but too rich will cause issues, as will too lean, so ensure you have a wideband lambda thats setup correctly (see the Lambda pdf or webpage). Dyno tuning is the only way to figure out exactly whats correct for the top lines, but these values are a good starting point.</font>

            My personal preference is to look at the logs, run the analiser and try to see why the software is trying to adjust it and manually tweak the table so it increases from left to right - bottom to top.</font></p>

            <h2><a name="auto"></a>Tune Analise Live</h2>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Auto-tune is a feature inside Tuner Studio 
              that can check your EGO correction to  the AFR targets (AFR Target Table) and alter the fuel map whilst you drive. It can be found 
              under <b>the Tune Analise Live tabe </b> if you have a registered version. You will need to pay for this using the software if you want these AutoTune features. Although many people 
              have had a lot of success with this feature and I'm sure I will be shot for 
              saying this, I don't think this is something you should get too carried away 
              with as it can tend to create some pretty bad maps if it's not used correctly. 
              I feel it's main purpose is to fine tune a map that is almost there. The trouble 
              I've found with it, is there's little way of knowing what's been changed whilst 
              you drive. It will only tune the area you are driving at so the fuel map could 
              end up being very lumpy due to the tuning being altered where driven and no 
              changes elsewhere. Looking at the map you would never know what areas had 
              been changed so you wouldn't know where to smooth off, etc. I recommend staying 
              clear of this unless you really know what your doing. It's not an answer to 
              tuning by driving up and down the road running autotune.</font> But it is very good for fine tuning a good map to make it a great map<br>
              Below is a map thats been tuned using AutoTune, it was miles away from being correct, but now its just full of lumps and bumps which the software has done to compensate for the bad start map. Always tune the VE table manually and keep an eye on it trying to keep it looking smooth. Once its manually tuned then try Autotune, but even then, keep looking at what its doing.</p>

            <p align="left"><font color="#000000">In the example the numbers no longer 
              increase with KPa like they should and there's a couple of large numbers 
              next to numbers a lot smaller, this isn't right. Start by smoothing out 
              the numbers around it and re-tune those points, ensure your Accel enrichments 
              are off, etc. Don't be too worried by this, the example is an extreme just 
            to show you what to look for. As you can see, near idle in this example, we have very high VE numbers, then at around 100KPa - 1200-1500rpm we have extreamly high numbers! Again at 128KPa / 4800rpm we have a lump of 120 inbetween 105 and 112, this is simply wrong. Smooth this area out and look at the logs to see why the software is adding so much fuel at this point. Remember, the numbers should roughly increase from left to right, bottom to top, like the example below:</font></p>

            <h2>Tuning the VE Table Live<font color="#000000"></h2
            >
            <p align="left">This is by far the best method of tuning, 
              but it does take 2 people to do it, one to drive, the other to operate the 
              laptop. <br>
              Ensure the engine is up to operating temperature before starting tuning the 
              VE table so that there are no warmup enrichments added to the mix. Also turn 
              the accel enrichments off by setting the MAPdot to 1000KPa and TPSdot to 1000V/S 
              so that all your tuning is the VE. I always turn the EGO correction off so 
              that there's no correction going on, to do this go to <b>Fuel Settings -- Ego Control </b> and set the <b>Controller Step Size</b> to ZERO. Now all 
              your going to tune is the table, the corrections can be turned on again later 
              once the table is tuned.<font color="#000000"> A WideBand lambda sensor is critical 
                to tune any engine unless your a real expert! Start by driving slowly, 
                  keeping load low and engine speed low until your happy that all is OK then 
                  move upwards. To tune the VE table live there are a couple of options. The 
                  best way is to use the 3D display (Tuner Studio <b>Tuning -- VE Table</b>) and 
                  drive to each cross point tuning as you go, this will need a driver and a 
                  passenger!! The red blob is where the engine is on the map and the cross 
                  hair  is where you are tuning, so use the arrow keys to go to the points 
                  you want to tune. Use the AFR gauge in the left side of the screen to see 
                  what the mixture is doing and increase or decrease the points where the red 
                  blob is to get the AFR correct. To increase the value (richen) press the &quot;Q&quot; 
                  button to slowly increment it or the &quot;E&quot; button to increase the 
                  value by 5. Like-wise the &quot;W&quot; button decreases it and &quot;R&quot; 
                  leans it off by 5 in one go. By gradually driving and tuning the points you 
                  will soon get a feel for what is needed. It's impossible to tune all the points, 
                  as it's unlikely youll drive at light throttle at 6000rpm, etc, so you will 
                  have to estimate the table at some of the points. The table should slowly 
                  increase in value as you go up the KPa scale and also increase in value as 
                  the RPM increases, it may fall off slightly as you pass the maximum torque 
                  point.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><font color="#000000"><img src="Pix/Tuneing3D.JPG" width="1279" height="627"></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000">If you start off and you find your having 
              to drastically change the values, then it may be better to pull over and adjust 
              the entire table in the same direction before going too far. So say you've 
              had to add 10-20 to the first few points, you will find the entire map will 
              probably need the same doing before you can fine tune it.</font><font color="#000000">To 
                do this pull over and close the 3D table down, and open the <b>VE Table in 
                  Fuel Setting -- Fuel VE Table1.</b>
                  As the engine should have already been tuned for a good idle leave that 
                part alone for now. All we need to alter is the parts where you feel were 
                a long way, so if cruising at 2000RPM was nearly OK but as soon as you went 
                up the load a little it went weak you will need to increase the table all 
                the way across the rev range but only above crusing KPa. To do this move the 
                mouse cursor to the start of where you want to alter (e.g. 100KPa - 600RPM) 
                and hold the left mouse key down, drag across the VE table and a box will 
                appear. Position the box so it is all the way across the RPM range above the 
                crusing KPa. </font></p>

            <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Now we have the area to increase highlighted, in this case we want to add 20% (Multiply by 1.2), so we will clcik on the &quot;*&quot; button and enter 1.2. <b>It is important to note that until you &quot;BURN&quot; the changes you make will be lost if you turn the MS ECU off, 
                so select Burn to ECU every so often</b>. The 
                  AFR your looking for will be different for each engine, but as a general rule 
                  of thumb 14.7 AFR is the most efficient mixture and is used for cruising, 
                  overrun can be a weak mixture but you may experience some poping through the 
                  exhaust if you go too lean. Max power is usually produced at around 12.5-13 
                  AFR, a turbo engine may need 11.5 to cool the valves, etc. I tend to aim for 
                  13-12.5AFR above 80KPa when tuning a NA engine. </font></p>

              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Once the VE table (fuel map) is tuned 
                you can now turn a few things back on in the tuning software to complete your installation.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">&#149;<b> Acceleration Enrichments (AE):</b></font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Set the thresholds up for either <strong>TPSdot </strong>(Change in TPS Voltage/Sec) or <strong>MAPdot</strong> (Change in MAP/Sec) so that the AE 
                cuts in when you push the throttle down fast, this usually creates a lean 
                moment where the fuel is stripped from the intake walls due to a sudden 
                change in pressure. The AE is used to add fuel to fill in the hole where 
                it goes lean. Most people tend to find TPSdot is the best settings . 
                Most manufactorures use TPSdot too. Remember that the higher the threshold value, the more change in TPS or MAP is needed to trigger the AE, so very low values mean it will trigger easily and probably when you don't need it, and very high values will mean it won't cut in unless you stab the throttle very fast!</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Start with the lower mS values 
                at the top and the higher values at the bottom of the tables. I've found 
                the below settings are a very good starting point, the lowest value should 
                be quite small.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000"> The<b> Accel Time</b> shouldn't usually go over 1.0S, usually 
                0.4 - 0.7S is fine. This is the length of time that the AE is added for, so it will fill in the hole created.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">The <strong>End Pulsewidth</strong> is a 
                great way to taper the AE down with time, usually this is set to 0.0mS, 
                in MS1 it can be found under AccelDecel Mode, where as for MS2-Extra and MS3 it 
                is in the Acceleration Wizard. This allows the AE to reduce the fuel down as time decreases, so the AE PW decreases over the <strong>Accel Taper Time </strong>period</font> after the <strong>Accel Time</strong></p>
              <p align="center"><img src="Pix/TpsMap_set.JPG" width="689" height="616"></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Deceleration Fuel Amount:</strong><br>This is the percentage of the fuel it uses when it detects deceleration. So 100% would be normal, 50% would be half the fuel. If using a boosted engine I'd recommend leaving this at 100% as you could trigger decel in boost by just backing off the accelerator a little but whilst still actually accelerating, this would give a lean condition, which isn't good in boost.  
                For NA cars 70-90% is the norm.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Cold Accel Enrichment:</strong><br>This is a linear addition thats added to the Accel PW depending on the coolant temperature. If you set it to 1.2mS then at -40F you will get the full 1.2mS added to the PW, this decreases up to Zero at 71C.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Cold Accel Mult:</strong><br>This is the same as the Cold Accel Enrichment but it multiplies the PW in the same linear format</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Pulse Width = Req_fuel x MAP x VE + <font color="#FFFF00">(AE x CAM + CAE)</font> + .......</strong></font></p>

                <p align="left"><font color="#000000">CAE = Cold Accel Multi</font></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">If your using Tuner Studio then you can see a histogram graph. This is excellent to work out what rate of change happened when you pushed the acelerator so you can find out what value to put into these thresholds.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>For MS2-Extra and MS3</strong> you can also blend the style of Acceleration trigger from TPS to MAP, using the slider in MT or the Percentage in TS. 0% is all MAP based, 100% is all TPS based, anywhere else is a percentage blend of the two. <br>
              </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">This is for <strong>MS2-Extra and MS3</strong> only. It allows the Acceleration amount to be scaled down with the engine speed. So in the example below, the Acceration enrichment percentage will be 100% of the PW from the table, like usual, until 2500rpm, then the amount of fuel added will taper off to 0% at 5000rpm. This is because the engine should need less fuel added at higher speeds.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><em><font color="#FFFF00">MS2-Extra and MS3 also have an Enhanced Accel Enrichment that is worth playing with once you have finished all tuning, keep it OFF for now.</font></em></p>

                at stoichiometric (14.7AFR), this is the most efficient mixture for cruising 
                so should be used as the EGO Switch Point in the Exhaust Gas Settings.</font></p>

                using an AFR Target Table. These tables can be set for use in <b>Lambda 
                  AFR Settings</b> for MS1-Extra, in MS2-Extra and MS3 ECUs they are automatically

              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Before tuning the spark table ensure the <strong>Trigger Angle</strong> has been checked and set using a timing strobe, this is more important than I can stress, so please do it!! </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Tuning the <strong>spark map</strong> may not seem the easiest thing in the world to do and it can be difficult to know where to start. Here is a base map that is for a Boosted engine (&gt;100KPa = Boost)</font></p>
              <p ALIGN="center"><img src="Drawings/SparkMap_Boost.jpg" width="721" height="515"> </p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Spark Map Tuning Basics:</strong><br>
              The idea is that the<strong> idle and low  speed </strong>area's are retarded to around 8-20deg,  but this depends on your engine's design. If you set  the first row in the RPM range as a little under your usual idle  (e.g.800 if your engine idles at 900ish) and add some advance here, so if the engine stumbles into this area the slight increase in  advance will help it to speed up the engine a little so it doesn't stall. (increase advance - increase engine speed when not under load) <br>
              The  <strong>cruising area</strong> of the map should have a reasonably high advance, (high 30's to low 40s) as the mixture will be reasonably lean and therefore  will give a slower burn. Adding advance here allows a leaner burn too. <br>
              As we increase <strong>above cruise</strong> but not full throttle, we should quickly remove a lot of the advance added for cruise, so as load increases the advance is similar to the Wide Open Throttle areas. This is because detonation can occure as load increases and you won't hang in those points for long, so may not even hear it unless youve got sensitive ears or knock sensors.<br>
              The<strong> overrun</strong> area can have an even greater  advance, this will allow you to run lean in that section, or as this example, it has very little advance so the fuel is kept in the cylinder for longer (cooling the pistons) and it gives a lovely popping out of the exhaust! (Run around 15AFR for this to work best).  I recommend a high advance if your not tuning for power or using a boosted engine. If you have aboosted engine then I would run low advance here, as the example, so we can get some cooling effect. This wont do your cat any good though!<br>
              At <strong>Wide  Open Throttle</strong> (WOT) the spark map needs to be RPM based (analogous to centrifugal advance on an old style distributor) coming in at the  right rate relative to engine RPM, once peak torque has been reached you can add some advance to try to maintain power. Keep an eye out for detonation at peak torque though!</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Note the the optimum amount of total advance is not necessarily  the most that doesn't cause detonation. For example, with a modern  cylinder head design, you might get maximum power at 32&deg;BTDC, but  might not experience any detonation until 38&deg;- 40&deg;. However you  will still want the advance to come in as quickly as possible  (without knocking) up to 32&deg;. For example, my 5.0L Rover based V8  produces max power around 28 - 30&deg;BTDC at WOT, but even at 36&deg; at WOT, I  have no detectable detonation.<BR><br>
                As the KPa increases (load increase) the spark  map should retard as the mixture will be richer and the chances of  detonation will also increase with the load. When going into boost  the advance table values will need to be lower than when out of boost  (&gt;100KPa = boost) and as the boost level increases the advance  will need to decrease with it, as detonation is more likely. It has  been said that 1deg of advance should be removed for every 2PSI of  boost (14KPa); this is simply a rough guide and lots of things can depend on  how much to remove including compression ratio. Detonation Cans are a  great option for tuning in boost, use a piece of copper pipe  flattened at one end with a flexible tube connected to it. Bolt the  flattened end to the cylinder head. Get an old set of ear defenders  and drill a hole into the side of them, push the other end or the  tube into the hole youve just drilled in the defenders and you should  be able to hear any detonation as it occurs. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Crusing is probably the hardest part of the spark map to tune, so  this will need several rows set up around that area, see setting the  KPa and RPM rows for fuel in the TPS or MAP PDF file (web page) as it follows  the same theory. Shunting in the crusing area is usually down to too  much advance, or too weak a mixture. If the mixture is correct (14.7  to 13.5 depending on your cam) then it may be worth removing advance  untill the shunting subsides. Too little advance will reduce throttle  responce so don't go too far, too little advance can also create  higher exhaust gas temperatures. Go back and check the AFR after  tuning this area, as the spark angle will effect the AFR readings.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><em><strong>One thing to bear in mind is that altering the spark table  WILL effect the AFR. So you will have to re-visit the VE table after  tuning the spark table. </strong></em> </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">If you experience detonation in your engine, then either:</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font color="#000000">* Your mixture is too lean. Increase the numbers in the VE table  at the point the engine detonates (or increase the Req_Fuel if the  detonation occurs at all points). Also make sure your fuel pump is  operating well. It may be supplying enough fuel at idle, but not  supplying enough when the demand rises. Use the oxygen sensor  readings to determine if you are lean,<BR>
                * You have oil leakage into  the combustion chamber (check the plugs for signs of oil). This could  come past the rings or seals (possibly worn, or from something that  was forgotten during assembly, or there are blocked drain back  passages in the head, or the rings have been damaged by detonation or  over-revving), a 'leaky' PVC system, or from a poor intake manifold  gasket seal allowing oil into the runners (on push rod V-engines),<BR>
                *  Your spark advance may come in too far and/or too fast. Edit the  spark advance table to lower the rate at which advance is added. You  may also need to limit the total advance. Most engines will not  require more than ~36&deg; at WOT (possibly more for a flathead design,  or a large open chamber, large piston dome design). Newer cylinder  head designs and 4 valve/cylinders heads generally don't require a  lot of advance,<BR>
                * You have spark plugs that are too hot (get a  range or two colder), or they are incorrectly torqued (if they are  loose, they over-heat because of poor thermal contact with the  head),<BR>
