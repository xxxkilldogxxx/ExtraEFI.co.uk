                            when I could buy one off some guy who made one and is trying to sell 
                            it on eBay? </b></font></p>
                        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333333">A: Blimey, that's a nice 
                          question for me. but it is an important one to answer.<br>
                          As far as I know, I'm the only supplier who builds custom made MS ECU's 
                          specific to the customers requirements. Most I've seen on eBay don't 
                          have what mine have. <br><br />
                  Let's take a Ford Zetec setup: An </font><font color="#333333">ECU 
                    from ExtraEFI will have a <font color="#000000"><a href="Drawings/PDF_Files/tacho_Wiring.pdf">Tacho 
                      output</a></font> (for the rev counter), <font color="#000000"><a href="Drawings/PDF_Files/4cy_Coil_Pack.pdf">2 
                        bosch spark drivers</a></font> (to directly fire the Ford coil pack), 
                      a <font color="#000000"><a href="Drawings/PDF_Files/WiringLoom_VR_Hall.pdf">colour 
                        coded wiring loom</a></font> which matches the wiring diagrams on my 
                      CD, a <font color="#000000"><a href="downloads.htm">CD</a></font> with 
                      loads and loads of info/help files, wiring tips, etc. on it, including 
                      the manuals I wrote and the tuning software! It will also come with 
                      an <font color="#000000"><a href="Drawings/PDF_Files/idle_valves.pdf">Idle 
                        Valve</a></font> output designed to fire the original Ford Idle Valve. 
                      It will be configured ready for the 36-1 
                      crank wheel and will be ready for you to install and start tuning. It 
                      will come with a <font color="#000000"><a href="terms.htm">warranty</a></font> and you will be buying it from someone who isn't just trying to sell 
                      you something and then offering no <font color="#000000"><a href="support.htm">backup</a></font>. 
                      You will also be buying it knowing it is built to a <font color="#000000">very 
                        high standard</font> and by someone who has made well over 500 of them 
                      and who is on the <font color="#000000">official recommended list of 
                        suppliers</font>. Need I say any more?</i></font></b></p>
                        <p align="left"><b><font color="#333333">Unfortunately I've seen 
                          it time and time again where someone buys an MS ECU off eBay, only 
                          to find out it won't run their engine, as it hasn't got enough spark 
                          drivers, it's not the version they thought it was, or the spark drivers 
                          are mounted incorrectly and they simply over heat and stop working,
                          or the build quality means it keeps breaking down, resetting when driving, 
                          etc. Some eBay sellers simply have no idea and will tell you it 
                          will work fine on your car, they don't care as long as they make some 
                          money. Where as I care about MegaSquirts, I've spent years developing 
                          it and years building them. I want it to work and will help you all 
                          I can until your happy. Just look at all the help files, drawings, backup 
                          pages, manuals, etc, I've written to assist you all. <br>
                          Lastly it may seem a bit cheaper, but there could be hidden costs for 
                          you, you'll need a wiring loom, comms cable, additional components to 
                          make it work, etc, my ECU's come with these items as standard. Where 
                          ever you decide to buy it from, just make sure they can back it up and 
                          that they are on the MS ECU recommended suppliers list! This list is 
                          there so you get what you pay for!<br><br />
                          Sorry, don't mean to go on, hopefully I've answered that for you.

                        <p><b><font color="#333333">A: Hi there, OK, this is the 
                          same as I would recommend for all RV8 based setups, TVR, Land Rovers, 
                          etc. You have 4 options:<br>
                  <font color="#000000">1) <a href="MS_All_products.htm">Fuel only</a>: </font>The distributor is kept as it is and you simply control fuel, 
                          (like the Lucas ECU does) You say you want ignition control too, so 
                          this option isn't really for you.<br><br />
                  <font color="#000000">2) <a href="MS_All_products.htm">Ignition and 
                    fuel</a>:</font> The distributor is locked inside so the weights and 
                          vacuum advance no longer move the trigger (points / sensor) this is 
                          easy to do by drilling a hole in the mechanism and putting a screw threw 
                          it, or welding it up. We can then fire the original ignition coil so 
                          you get mappable fuel and ignition using the distributor. This isn't 
                          the most accurate way to control ignition as the distributor's tend 
                          to wear and trigger timing varies due to gear wear, etc. (I had 4deg 
                          play in my own RV8 distributor setup)<br><br />

                    ignition, wasted spark (EDIS8) and fuel</a></font>: This means you'll 
                          need to fit a 36-1 crank wheel on the front pulley, a crank sensor to 
                          pick up the crank wheel, an EDIS8 module and a pair of 4cy Ford coil 
                          packs. This will give you wasted spark and an acurate timing pulse off 
                          the crank. Using the EDIS8 module means the spark drivers are external 
                          to the ECU, this keeps noise down in the ECU and helps for a nice install 
                          without issues. <br><br />

                          all the same parts except for the EDIS8 module. Where this differs is 
                          the MS ECU will have 4 spark drivers inside it that directly fire the 
                          coil packs. This can tend to be nosiey in the ECU, so precautions like 
                          grounds all back to the engine block, resistive spark plugs, resistive 
                          HT leads, capacitors on the coil packs, etc. All these precautions should 
                          be followed regardless of if its an EDIS or directly fired ECU, but 
                          the direct fired ECU is more prone to noise, so it is a must on them! 
                          TVR's for instance, tend to have poor earths, so can be prone to noise, 
                          but with the right guidelines these can run without issues. <a href="resets.htm">See

                          diagram is easy to follow and all you have to do is splice into your

                    conditioner, which means you can use your original 36-1 toothed wheel 
                    and crank sensor(VR Sensor), as fitted to most Ford EFI setups as well 
                    as many other vehicles. As for setting up the MegaSquirt, take a look 
                    at the <a href="MSLVV_tuning.htm">Tuning MegaSquirt</a> pages I've written. 
                    I've also written loads of manuals for setting up, tuning, wiring, etc 
                    for the MS, see <a href="http://www.msextra.com/manuals/MS_Extra_Manual_Index.htm" target="_parent">here</a>. 
                    The more you read and understand the easier it will be to set up. I'm 
                    not going to tell you its easy, but it's certainly not hard if you put 
                    the effort in and it is very rewarding, Phil</font><font color="#666666"><br>

                    so I wouldn't like to say if it can take 8psi of boost, but I can tell 
                    you I added 8psi of boost to a 9.75:1 compression ratio 3.5L Rover V8 
                    without any internal changes. I used a MegaSquirt ECU to control the 
                    fuel and ignition on that engine. But one thing is for sure, you will 
                    definetly need to control fuel and spark with an aftermarket ECU, it 
                    will not work efficiently just adding a few injectors or piggybacking 
                    your original injectors. Megasquirt will definetly control your setup 
                    very well, it is an ideal ECU for your purpose. I would think you'll 
                    need a larger set of injectors at least, it depends on what power you 
                    anticipate getting from the engine and the flow rates of your current 
                    injectors, (this can be found from the Internet). You really need to 
                    read the MS manuals <a href="http://www.msextra.com/manuals/MS_Extra_Manual_Index.htm">here</a>. 
                    If you decide Megasquirt is the way to go for you then you can purchase 
                    an ECU from me. Good luck with your project, Phil</font><br>

                    circuit and the shift lights outputs, (the shift lights would be limited 
                    to one light as there's only enough connections on the standard 37 pin 
                    connector for 4 outputs, and I use one for the second Spark output on 
                    a 4cy wasted setup). All you'll need to do then is add a couple of switches, 
                    one on the clutch pedal for launch and one on the dash for switching 
                    tables. I don't actually fit the ECU's to any cars for the general public,

                            the best Megasquirt module for this and how much would it cost for you

              <font color="#333333"><br>
                A: Hi there, the EDIS system is a very reliable setup that is not prone 
                to noise, etc, so is a good way to get wasted spark. As for LPG, the best 
                option would be to have it wired for switched tables (so you run one fuel 
                map and spark map when in petrol mode and a completely different one in 
                LPG mode) this will allow you to tune the 2 fuels virtually independently. 
                For adding a switcheable input I would charge &pound;8 more, so its not 
                very expensive. Good luck with your project, Phil</font><font color="#666666"><br>

                A: Hi there, as far as wiring goes you need the relevant plugs for all 
                your sensors. You should already have all the sensors needed on the engine, 
                Air Temperature Sensor, etc. Virtually all original equipment sensors 
                will work fine with the MS ECU. Your Zetec would have a crank sensor on 
                it and a 36-1 trigger wheel which can be used directly with a V3.0 MS. 
                You should also have a coil pack sat on top of the engine, this can be 
                directly driven from this MS ECU V3.0 too, so you'll have fuel and ignition

              <br>
              <font color="#333333">A: Hi there, yes the MAF (Mass Airflow Meter) can 
                be thrown away if the hardware allows it, as some setups have the MAF 
                built into the inlet manifold. The MegaSquirt ECU's have a built in Manifold 
                Air Pressure sensor (known as Speed Density mode) which you can use or 
                you can use a Throttle position pot (that's what's called Alpha_n mode). 
                It can even be adapted to use a MAF if it has a 0-5V output signal (e.g. 
                a Ford item) so yes, the restriction of a MAF can be removed if you so

                that is fully insured postage that has to be signed for. You'll need all 
                the relevant sensors that a normal EFI setup needs (Air and Coolant Temperature 
                Sensors, a Lambda sensor, a throttle position sensor and compatable trigger 
                input from a coil / crank sensor or a distributor) If you want to keep 
                the original sensors that came with your setup you can. There are instructions 
                on the CD that I supply on how to use different sensors with the ECU and 
                the software or I can do it for you if you give me the information, see <a href="software/Temp_Sensor_Instructions.pdf">here</a>. I can't preprogram 
                an ECU that's ready to be used without tuning. I can pre-load the ECU 
                with settings for your engine with a base map, etc, but it will need tuning 
                for your setup. If you can find someone on the <a href="http://www.msextra.com">MSExtra</a> forum that has an engine the same as yours you may find that a lot of 
                help, but the best thing to do is to read the manuals I've compiled and 
                learn how to do it from scratch, its all part of the fun of it. Any good 
                professional tuner should be able to tune your engine with an MS ECU,

                          can turn the ignition on, ensure the sensor and original ECU, etc, is 
                          still connected as it should be, and slowly turn the engine over (remove 
                          the distributor cap so it doesn't spark) If the voltage switches from 
                          5 or 12V to ground (0V) then you have a hall sensor. It is important 
                          to know if the voltage is 5 or 12V when it see's a tooth or if its see's 
                          a gap between the teeth. <br>
                          If you get no voltage then re-assemble the cap and start the engine. 
                          Measure the voltage from the sensor at idle (be very very careful!!) 
                          if it reads approx 0.5Vac then you have a VR sensor. Increase the RPM 
                          to 2500 and see if the voltage increases, this means you have a VR sensor. 
                          Most VR sensors have a small round nipple in the middle on the end of 
                          the sensor where it looks at the teeth, this is the core. Hall sensors 
                          generally do not have this.<br>
