        <td width="100%" height="939" bgcolor="#666666"><p align="left"><p><b>Let's Start at the Basics:</b></p>
          <p align="left">All Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI)  systems basically work in the same way. They use various combinations  of sensors to monitor positions, temperatures, exhaust gases, engine  load and engine speed to calculate how much fuel will be put into the  engine and, more often than not, when to ignite that fuel.</p>
          <p><em><strong>Fuel:</strong></em></p>
          <p>If we consider the Lucas systems (14CUX  and 4CU) as used on the TVR RV8 engines, then we don&rsquo;t have any  ignition control, the ECU is only concerned with fuel. The amount of  fuel it puts into the cylinder is controlled by how long the injector  is open for. The ECU reads the signals from the sensors and uses this  information to determine a &lsquo;position&rsquo; in the data tables within  its memory. These tables contain values for injector opening times,  as the state of the engine changes, so does the amount of fuel being  delivered. In order to understand how the system works, we need to  know what the sensors are, and how the signals are used.</p>
          <p><strong>Air Flow Meter. (Flapper / Hotwire) </strong> </p>
          <p>Love them or hate them, these are used  by most manufacturers as a way of measuring the air flow into the  engine and thereby determining the amount of fuel needed to be mixed  with that air.  Early versions of the air flow meter consisted of a  sprung &lsquo;flap&rsquo; placed in the inlet air flow.  This flap is  &lsquo;pushed&rsquo; open by the air being drawn into the engine.  Although  fairly rudimentary, these systems did at least offer some indication  of the load that the engine was under, and controlled the fuelling  system in most situations.  Later versions, such as the &lsquo;Hotwire&rsquo;  air flow meters, were much better at determining &lsquo;Air Mass&rsquo;  passing through them.  The advantage of knowing the mass, rather than  just volume, of air passing through the sensor is that air density,  which affects the combustion characteristics of the air, is taken  into account.  This means that, in theory at least, the engine will  be optimally fuelled in all atmospheric conditions. </p>
          <p><strong>Inlet Air Temperature Sensor (IAT)</strong> <em> (Built into the AFM on the Lucas ECU)</em> </p>
          <p>This sensor  changes resistance with temperature (increase in temperature -  decreases resistance). It is used to calculate the density of  the air coming into the engine. The hotter the air, the thinner it  will be (less dense) so we will need less fuel. The colder the air  the more dense it is, so we need more fuel to maintain the same  mixture. The ECU will use the temperature as part of a calculation to  work out how much to alter the fuelling to allow for the actual air  density. This formula is known as Boules law, you may remember it  from Physics at school. The actual calculation isn&rsquo;t important, as  long as you appreciate its function.</p>
          <p><strong>Coolant Temperature Sensor (CTS)</strong> </p>
          <p>This sensor, like  the IAT, changes resistance with temperature (increase in temperature  - decreases resistance) When an engine is cold, the inlet  walls soak up more fuel than they will when hot and the engine will  also need to run a little richer for the fuel to mix well in the air.  So the ECU will use a lookup table to work out how much extra fuel  needs to be added while running during the &lsquo;warm-up&rsquo; period. This  is usually a percentage addition made to the load tables mentioned  earlier. As an example, at a temperature of 45 degrees C, we might  determine that the engine requires an extra 10% fuel delivery,  compared to the full running temperature value that is stored in the  fuel table.  We therefore produce a second table (warm-up) which adds  that 10% to the calculation before the signal is sent to the  injectors.  Because we use the optimal running temperature of the  engine as a 100% reference point, the 45 degree value for the fuel  table will be referred to as 110%. The coolant sensor is also used to  work out the amount of fuel injected into the engine during cranking,  in fact, for fuelling, all the ECU will care about, during cranking,  is the coolant temperature.</p>
          <p><strong>Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)</strong></p>
          <p>This is a simple  &lsquo;potentiometer&rsquo; that varies resistance as it rotates.  The 3  pinned sensor is fed with a reference voltage, usually 5V, and as it  is rotated gives a variable voltage output, 0V when the throttle is  closed, 5V when the throttle is fully open.</p>
          <p>The ECU can use this sensor as an  indication of engine load and also as a measure of how fast the  throttle has been moved. Although variables such as air mass and  engine vacuum are not taken into consideration, the degree to which  the throttle is opened is a reasonably good indication of the load  that the engine is under. On the TVR500 engines, I believe that the  TPS is used once the AFM reaches its limit, so switching from AFM to  TPS as the load scale for the fuelling at high RPM. </p>
          <p><strong>Exhaust Gas Oxygen &ndash; EGO (Lambda  Sensor)</strong></p>
          <p>The Lucas Hotwire system, like most  other manufacturers, uses a narrow band lambda probe. This probe is  mounted in the exhaust gas stream and measures the amount of un-burnt  fuel remaining in the exhaust gas.  A reference figure for ideal  combustion is known as the &lsquo;Stoichimetric&rsquo; mixture and is  indicated by an Air Fuel Ratio (AFR) of 14.7:1 or a &lsquo;Lambda&rsquo;  value of 1. If the exhaust AFR is less that  14.7:1 (or Lambda below 1), the mixture is termed as &lsquo;Rich&rsquo; and  inversely, if above 14.7 (or Lambda above 1) then it is lean. This  may sound complicated, but is actually relatively straightforward  when viewed.</p>
          <p>The ECU uses this  information to decide whether to increase the fuel a little or  decrease it, depending if the probe is telling it its rich or lean.  The fuelling will be corrected approximately twice or three times a  second, so it is constantly trying to maintain a target AFR. This is  known as &ldquo;Exhaust Gas Oxygen (EGO) correction&rdquo;. There will be a  limit to how much the ECU can trim this correction, probably 10-15%  in the Lucas 14CUX.</p>
          <p>When &lsquo;narrowband&rsquo; sensors are used,  the correction is only carried out at low engine loads and speeds.   This is because narrowband sensors, as their names suggest, can only  measure a very narrow &lsquo;window&rsquo; of air fuel ratio.  The  complication here is that a performance engine tends to run best at  AFR&rsquo;s approaching 12.5:1, at least when under heavy loads, and  therefore a narrowband sensor is pretty well useless unless the car  is cruising or running at very low loads. </p>
          <p><em>As a side note the more modern  &lsquo;Wideband&rsquo; sensors are far more preferable as they measure a far  wider spectrum of AFR and can therefore be used to attain correct AFR  under many different conditions.</em></p>
          <p><em>A Wideband lambda setup (TechEdge,  Innovates) can detect over the full mixture range, 10-20AFR and  should be thought of as an essential tool for tuning any performance  engine.</em><BR>
          </p>
          <p>That&rsquo;s all the sensors covered for  the Lucas setup, so now we can move onto the devices it controls:</p>

          <p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Fuel  Pump</strong><BR><br>
            The High Pressure Fuel Pump  is gravity fed and is mounted &lsquo;inline&rsquo; between the fuel tank and  the engine. In order to get the fuel into the engine, an injector  requires a volume of fuel to be available at a certain pressure. If  the pressure is too low, the injectors will not &lsquo;spray&rsquo; the fuel,  it will just dribble through.  If the pressure is too high, the  injector will not be able to stop the fuel from flowing past it and  the injector will be forced open. When the pressure is correct the  injector will produce a well &lsquo;atomised&rsquo; mist of fuel that will be  easily &lsquo;vaporised&rsquo; as it is pulled into the engine. Pressure in  the system can vary from manufacturers but 32psi - 45 psi is roughly  correct. 36 psi is the pre-set pressure for the RV8 EFI engines. The  fuel pressure is actually controlled by a Fuel Pressure Regulator  which is pre-set to allow a pressure of 36 psi to be maintained  within the fuel rail. A pressure reference pipe (vacuum pipe)  attached to the plenum chamber, &lsquo;holds&rsquo; the pressure regulator  until the Manifold Actual Pressure (MAP) reduces (this happens when  the throttle is opened) and then allows the pressure to rise to 36  psi.  This is used as a means of enriching the engine slightly when  the throttle is opened and also helps to maintain fuel pressure in  the rail as the injectors open for longer. This is important for the  ECU, as it needs a constant pressure to ensure that any given opening  time will allow the same amount of fuel to flow under all conditions.</p>
          <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="Pix/Picture 2.JPG" width="743" height="434"></p>
          <p>The  Fuel Return Line is not under pressure, it is simply the excess fuel  that the pump has supplied that the regulator didn't need to maintain  its required pressure. Some Fuel Rails are large in diameter to allow  for a greater volume of fuel to be held behind the injector.</p>
          <p><strong>Injectors</strong></p>
          <p>The injector is basically a solenoid,  or electrically operated valve, which opens when a voltage is allowed  to pass through it. A 12V feed is applied to one pin and the ECU  switches the other pin to ground in order open the solenoid.  As the  solenoid opens, fuel is allowed to flow through the injector and into  the inlet port. There is no positive or negative to an injector so  they can be connected either way round.<strong> </strong> </p>
          <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="Pix/Picture 3.jpg" width="384" height="261"></p>
          <p ALIGN="CENTER"><BR>
          </p>
          <p>The longer they are opened for, the  more fuel passes through. There is a limit to how much fuel can be  delivered by any given injector, this referred to as the injector  flow rate.  This is important as injectors become less accurate as  they open and close too fast.  The fastest effective speed that an  injector can open, close and then open again is referred to as the  Duty Cycle.  The maximum recommended duty cycle to maintain accurate  fuel delivery is 85%, if the injectors have to &lsquo;work&rsquo; harder than  this, it is time to get bigger injectors! </p>
          <p>As explained above, the fuel pressure  is regulated so if it is opened for say 1.5mS, the same amount of  fuel will flow from the injector under all load conditions. An  injector is rated by its flow in either lbs/hr or cc/min, this is  usually measured with a fuel pressure of 43PSI.<BR><br>
              <strong>1  lb/hr ~ 10.5cc/min</strong></p>
          <p>A  rough guide to selecting injectors is: <BR><br>
              <strong>Injector  Size = (Horse Power * BSFC) / (#Injectors * Duty Cycle) </strong><BR>
            BSFC  = brake specific fuel consumption. This is usually between 0.42 and  0.58 at wide open throttle. Normally aspirated engines with efficient  combustion processes are at the lower end of the BSFC scale ~0.45,  where as a supercharged engine tend to be towards the higher end  ~0.55. <BR>
            Using &lsquo;bigger&rsquo;, or indeed  &lsquo;smaller&rsquo;, injectors within a management system controlled by a  &lsquo;Standard&rsquo; ECU is not recommended.  The standard ECU will be  expecting a certain amount of fuel to be delivered by each injector  pulse, if the injector delivers more or less than this, the engine  will be running rich or lean. In a &lsquo;mappable&rsquo; ECU system,  injector sizes are often changed to optimise alterations made to the  engine.</p>
          <p>There  is a misconception that you can simply increase fuel pressure to  increase your injectors flow rate. Fuel flow doesn't increase at the  same rate as pressure, flow increases at the square root of fuel  pressure, so you'll need a massive increase in fuel pressure to gain  much from an injector. There is a limit that your pump and pipes and  injectors can take, increase fuel pressure too far and the injectors  will not shut properly, the pattern will change and pipe work is  stressed. </p>

          <p><strong>Idle Valves</strong> </p>
          <p>When an engine is cold, cylinder  pressures and piston clearances tend to be a little less than  optimal.  This means that cold engines need to run a little faster,  and generally a little richer at idle in order to run smoothly. This  need is serviced by an idle air control valve (stepper motor) in a  Lucas Hotwire system. The idle engine speed that the ECU will try to  maintain will depend directly on the coolant sensor. Once up to  normal running temperature the idle valve will be nearly closed and  will then only be used as an anti stall device if the engine speed  drops too low.</p>

          </p>
          <p>On the Flapper engines, the idle is  controlled using an Extra Air Valve, which is basically a bi-metal  strip that opens when it&rsquo;s cold, allowing air to flow into the  intake and closes slowly as it warms up. The Flapper ECU had no  control over this item.<BR>

          <p align="center" class="style15"><em><strong>Ignition:</strong></em></p>
          <p><strong>Timing</strong></p>
          <p>The fuel air mixture within the  combustion chamber of a petrol engine burns at a specific rate.  This  rate is determined by a number of factors (Fuel Octane, cylinder  pressure, Oxygen content etc.) but for most us running normal grade  pump fuel and normally aspirated engines the rate is fixed.  As an  engine runs at higher speed we need to allow it a few more degrees of  rotation to achieve full combustion and therefore make the most of  each &lsquo;burn&rsquo;.  If the spark were to be discharged at the same  degree of rotation at any engine speed, the fuel would not have time  to burn when the engine ran faster.  We achieve this by adjusting the  spark &lsquo;timing&rsquo;.  Timing is measured in degrees of crankshaft  rotation before Top Dead Centre (the point at which a piston stops  its upward motion and begins its journey back down the cylinder).   This &lsquo;ignition timing&rsquo; is controlled via a sensor within the  distributor and the Lucas ECU has no control over this what-so-ever.  This is fundamentally the same system that was used on engines up to  the early 80&rsquo;s, whereby a pair of weights inside the distributor  body, are thrown outwards with the centrifugal force as the speed of  the distributor shaft increases. This in turn, moves the plate that  the sensor is bolted to by a few degrees, which means the coil fires  earlier as engine speed increases. The movement is limited to around  20 or so degrees.</p>
          <p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong><img src="Pix/Picture 5.jpg" width="600" height="450"></strong></p>
          <p>There is also a vacuum diaphragm  connected to the plate. This adds more advance under light throttle  conditions, allowing the ECU to run the engine leaner under those  conditions.</p>
          <p>The sensor will trigger the signal  amplifier unit, which is connected to the coil.<BR>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Coil</strong></p>
          <p>The coil is a  relatively simple device which has 2 windings inside it. The central  winding is the <strong>Primary</strong> and then there&rsquo;s a <strong>Secondary</strong> winding wound around that. The secondary has 100's of times more  windings than the primary. This then acts in a similar way to a 'step  up' transformer.<BR>
            The Primary winding has a 12V ignition feed to it  and the other side (-ve) is grounded by the amplifier. When the -ve  side is grounded the coil charges up until it is saturated (reaches  its maximum current) this is known as the <strong>dwell  time</strong>. The -ve side of the primary is  then suddenly opened by the amplifier. As the primary voltage  collapses it creates a massive magnetic field that in turn induces a  huge voltage to flow into the secondary winding (due to the very  large number of turns in the winding). <BR>
          This voltage is then sent  to the distributor and, depending on the position of the &lsquo;rotor  arm&rsquo; to a spark plug. The secondary winding's voltage is  &lsquo;searching&rsquo; for a ground and, if everything is well insulated,  the nearest ground will be on the tip of the spark plug where it will  jump across to create a spark. The larger the spark plug gap, the  larger the voltage needs to be to jump across it.<span class="style18"><BR>

          <p align="center" class="style18"><strong>Summary of the  14CUX (and 4CU)</strong></p>
          <p>These are my  opinions, and let&rsquo;s face it, I am a likely to be a little biased,  so others will have a different spin on it. There is nothing major to  worry about as far as fuel goes, it all works fine, not the most  efficient or modern setup by a long shot, but it works, up to a  point:</p>
          <p>If you change  something in the engine, e.g. different specification camshaft or  increased capacity then you may start to have fuelling issues. If you  fit a blower or anything that increases power, then you will  definitely have issues with the standard ECU. If you have a TVR 500  engine, then your MAF will hit its maximum output long before the  engine does. So again, this is an issue. The fix by TVR was to switch  over to TPS as the AFM peaks. This is fine, but the AFM may as well  not be there as it becomes a restriction once its maximum flow rate  has been reached.</p>
          <p>It is possible to  swap the EPROM inside most of the Lucas 14CUX ECU's but this would be  what's known as a &ldquo;best guess&rdquo; map, which isn't a real answer.  I've tuned a lot of RV8 engine's and never ended up with the same map  inside any of them, so a &ldquo;best guess&rdquo; EPROM is going to be like a  lottery. </p>
          <p>The hotwire ECU  can be re-programmed to match your engine, this would be the best  solution for keeping the 14CUX and having an engine running its  optimum fuelling, but due to the fact that only a couple of people in  the world have the equipment to do it, its not going to be an easy  solution. Remember that if any more changes are made to the engine,  it would mean going through this process again.</p>
          <p>The technology  within the Lucas is well past it, electronics moves so very quickly  and the late 80s was hundreds of years ago, as far as technology is  concerned (think ZX Spectrum). This means that modern ECU&rsquo;s can  calculate the fuelling far more accurately, control the injectors  with far more precision and can carry out far more functions than  Lucas could have ever imagined. </p>
          <p>So what does that  mean in the real world?  Let&rsquo;s consider the fuel flow from an  injector. With all else being equal, the engines&rsquo; emissions and  power are all related to how much fuel enters the cylinder, how it  burns and how it is removed. Controlling this fuel accurately is  critical to efficiency and the power, as its all down to how long  those injectors are opened for by the ECU. </p>
          <p>Take an example  of an injector opening time of 2.0mSec at say 1500RPM (cruising) </p>
          <p><em>We will ignore  opening time for now (time taken for the injector&rsquo;s internals to  move to allow flow)</em></p>
          <p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s  giving a mixture of 15.3 AFR. We ideally want 14.7 AFR.</p>
          <p>So we add 0.1mS  to the opening time.</p>
          <p><em>Whilst I have  no proof of this, I suspect that&rsquo;s about as small an opening step  that the Lucas can provide given the technology around its  development. </em> </p>
          <p>So we have  increased the fuel flow by 0.1mS/2.0mS * 100 = 5% </p>
          <p>So the AFR will  now alter by 5%, so it will be 14.5AFR, rather than 15.3AFR. </p>
          <p>This means we can  only step in 0.8AFR jumps at low engine speeds.</p>
          <p>Where as a modern  ECU can control the injectors down to 0.001mS and even lower, so  theoretically in 0.008AFR steps given the same figures as above. </p>
          <p>Let&rsquo;s now  consider the ignition. Well the TVR setup has no technology in that  what so ever, which is good as it means there&rsquo;s a ton of  improvements that we can make to it! </p>
          <p>The High Tension  voltage is generated by the coil, which is switched on by an  amplifier, the length it is turned on for is what&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;dwell  time&rdquo;. This is how long the coil is charged for before it is  discharged. The discharge generates the spark, so unless the coil  reaches its maximum charge (saturation) we will lose power on the HT  side resulting in a weak spark. </p>
          <p>Well a standard  ignition coil needs approx 4.0mS to charge and 1.0mS to discharge, a  total of 5mS. On a distributor based V8, this has to happen 4 times  for every engine rotation (4 stroke engine) </p>
          <p>So that&rsquo;s 5mS x  4 = 20mS to fully charge and discharge the coil each revolution. </p>
          <p>20mS is the same  time it takes an engine to rotate at 3000RPM. </p>
          <p>So any engine  speed above 3000RPM and the coil is not reaching saturation,  therefore the spark is starting to weaken. </p>
          <p>Now think of  6000RPM, that&rsquo;s 10mS for 4 sparks, or 2.5mS for each spark. Take  the discharge time away and there&rsquo;s only 1.5mS to charge the coil.  It&rsquo;s simply impossible to fully charge it in that time, so the  result is a weaker spark. </p>
          <p>Whilst we are  talking about the ignition, the timing accuracy is all down to a  chain and gear driven sensor which has backlash and other  inaccuracies inherent to them. </p>
          <p align="center" class="style26">Aftermarket ECU&rsquo;s</p>
          <p ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="../../WebstormProjects/extraefiNEW/img/Package.jpg" width="800" height="533"></p>
          <p>A MegaSquirt MS2  or MS3 ECU has the timing accuracy of 0.1deg and the fuelling is  theoretically capable of up to 0.16uS resolution. The MS3 has two  processors, one calculating the ignition (which is time critical),  the other calculating the fuelling, etc. </p>
          <p>Whilst you may  say this is over kill, it allows the ECU to be designed to do much  more, for example: Sequential fuelling, Sequential ignition, Mappable  fuel timing, Knock control, Launch control, Variable Valve Timing  (VVT), Shift lights, Fan outputs, CAN databus link, Switchable maps,  Wideband Lambda correction, EGT measuring, Boost control, etc, etc,  etc. None of this could be done using the Lucas system. </p>
          <p>So as you can  see, the Lucas system works on a standard engine, but compare it to  any modern ECU and its short falls soon become apparent.  If you have  any modifications carried out on your engine, e.g. cam, different  size injectors, heads ported, etc, then the Lucas will need either  re-programming or it simply won&rsquo;t fuel it efficiently for those  modifications. This is where an aftermarket ECU comes into its own,  as they can be mapped so the fuelling is correct for any engine with  just about any modification. </p>
          <p>Throw in mappable  ignition control (as fitted to virtually all aftermarket ECU&rsquo;s) and  you&rsquo;ll have a much more driveable engine that is more efficient and  probably give out more power over all or at least part of the rev  range. </p>
          <p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong><img src="Pix/Picture 7.JPG" width="543" height="392"></strong></p>
          <p>Wasted spark is  the most common upgrade for the ignition system, using a MegaSquirt  ECU, this allows the coils to fully saturate at 6000rpm and beyond,  so no more weak sparks at the plugs. </p>
        <p>Most people&rsquo;s  comments I hear from MegaSquirt fitted cars are how much better and  nicer it is to drive. A lot of this comes from combining fuel and  ignition control in an ECU, as the two work together. Fuelling is  directly related to ignition timing, so being able to map both works  out for a much better setup.</p>
