                  I agree, there is
                  a lot of information out there and half of it is either irrelevant or

                                              it's a short list of what you really need to know to get running. Then

                  Blimey, that's a nice
                  question for me. but it is an important one to answer.<br>                            As far as I know, I'm the only supplier who builds custom made MS ECU's
                                              specific to the customers requirements. Most I've seen on eBay don't
                                              have what mine have. <br><br>                            Let's take a Ford Zetec setup: An ECU
                                              from ExtraEFI will have a <a href="Drawings/PDF_Files/tacho_Wiring.pdf">
                    Tacho
                    output</a> (for the rev counter), <a href="Drawings/PDF_Files/4cy_Coil_Pack.pdf">
                    2
                    bosch spark drivers</a> (to directly fire the Ford coil pack),
                                              a <a href="Drawings/PDF_Files/WiringLoom_VR_Hall.pdf">
                    colour
                    coded wiring loom</a> which matches the wiring diagrams on my
                                              CD, a <a href="downloads.htm">CD</a> with
                                              loads and loads of info/help files, wiring tips, etc. on it, including
                                              the manuals I wrote and the tuning software! It will also come with
                                              an <a href="Drawings/PDF_Files/idle_valves.pdf">
                    Idle
                    Valve</a> output designed to fire the original Ford Idle Valve.
                                              It will be configured ready for the 36-1
                                              crank wheel and will be ready for you to install and start tuning. It
                                              will come with a <a href="terms.htm">warranty</a> and you will be buying it from someone who isn't just trying to sell
                                              you something and then offering no <a href="support.htm">backup</a>.
                                              You will also be buying it knowing it is built to a very
                                                  high standard and by someone who has made well over 500 of them
                                              and who is on the official recommended list of
                                                  suppliers. Need I say any more?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately I've seen
                  it time and time again where someone buys an MS ECU off eBay, only
                  to find out it won't run their engine, as it hasn't got enough spark
                  drivers, it's not the version they thought it was, or the spark drivers
                  are mounted incorrectly and they simply over heat and stop working,
                  or the build quality means it keeps breaking down, resetting when driving,
                  etc. Some eBay sellers simply have no idea and will tell you it
                  will work fine on your car, they don't care as long as they make some
                  money. Where as I care about MegaSquirts, I've spent years developing
                  it and years building them. I want it to work and will help you all
                  I can until your happy. Just look at all the help files, drawings, backup
                  pages, manuals, etc, I've written to assist you all. <br>                            Lastly it may seem a bit cheaper, but there could be hidden costs for
                                              you, you'll need a wiring loom, comms cable, additional components to
                                              make it work, etc, my ECU's come with these items as standard. Where
                                              ever you decide to buy it from, just make sure they can back it up and
                                              that they are on the MS ECU recommended suppliers list! This list is
                                              there so you get what you pay for!<br><br>                            Sorry, don't mean to go on, hopefully I've answered that for you.<br>Phil.

                  then NO, you will not need anything else other than a laptop, some time
                  and patience. The ECU's I sell all come with a one meter long, fully
                  labeled <a href="Pix/cable.jpg" target="_blank">wiring harness</a>,
                                              an RS232 cable (for connection to your laptop) and a CD with all the

                                              a relay). Normally the only relay you'll need to control is the Fuel

                <p>
                  Hi there, OK, this is the
                  same as I would recommend for all RV8 based setups, TVR, Land Rovers,
                  etc. You have 4 options:<br>                            1) <a href="MS_All_products.htm">Fuel only</a>: The distributor is kept as it is and you simply control fuel,
                                              (like the Lucas ECU does) You say you want ignition control too, so
                                              this option isn't really for you.<br><br>                            2) <a href="MS_All_products.htm">
                    Ignition and
                    fuel</a>: The distributor is locked inside so the weights and
                                              vacuum advance no longer move the trigger (points / sensor) this is
                                              easy to do by drilling a hole in the mechanism and putting a screw threw
                                              it, or welding it up. We can then fire the original ignition coil so
                                              you get mappable fuel and ignition using the distributor. This isn't
                                              the most accurate way to control ignition as the distributor's tend
                                              to wear and trigger timing varies due to gear wear, etc. (I had 4deg
                                              play in my own RV8 distributor setup)<br><br>                            3) <a href="Misc_products.htm#ediskits">
                    Distributorless
                    ignition, wasted spark (EDIS8) and fuel</a>: This means you'll
                                              need to fit a 36-1 crank wheel on the front pulley, a crank sensor to
                                              pick up the crank wheel, an EDIS8 module and a pair of 4cy Ford coil
                                              packs. This will give you wasted spark and an acurate timing pulse off
                                              the crank. Using the EDIS8 module means the spark drivers are external
                                              to the ECU, this keeps noise down in the ECU and helps for a nice install
                                              without issues. <br><br>                            4) <a href="MS_All_products.htm">
                    Distributorless
                    ignition, wasted spark, directly firing the coils from the MS ECU and
                    fuel</a>, : This is very similar to the EDIS option, you'd need
                                              all the same parts except for the EDIS8 module. Where this differs is
                                              the MS ECU will have 4 spark drivers inside it that directly fire the
                                              coil packs. This can tend to be nosiey in the ECU, so precautions like
                                              grounds all back to the engine block, resistive spark plugs, resistive
                                              HT leads, capacitors on the coil packs, etc. All these precautions should
                                              be followed regardless of if its an EDIS or directly fired ECU, but
                                              the direct fired ECU is more prone to noise, so it is a must on them!
                                              TVR's for instance, tend to have poor earths, so can be prone to noise,
                                              but with the right guidelines these can run without issues. <a href="resets.htm">

But I want an easy solution to plug into my existing sensors or even Ford loom. I have looked through your site, but I would like some more information please.

                  You can use all of the Ford
                  sensors, the idle valve and the coil packs, etc, with the MegaSquirt's
                  I sell. I don't sell an adapter to plug into your loom but the wiring
                  diagram is easy to follow and all you have to do is splice into your
                  loom or get an old Ford ECU and turn it into an adapter between the
                  Ford and MegaSquirt loom. I have done this for several installs and
                  it is a good method of keeping the wiring in the car as close to original
                  as possible. You don't need the MAF sensor, we have a built in MAP sensor
                  on the ECU and this is the best option for you in my opinion. It's only
                  a case of piping it into the intake manifold (engine side of the throttle
                  plate) <br>                            You shouldn't need to switch maps for emissions as the tested area can
                                              be tuned to pass and this will be OK to run in as well, as when they
                                              test the car the engine isn't under load so it won't be in a position
                                              on the map where you need to run rich for power, but if you need a switched
                                              map input then this is £8 extra. Phil

                  Well some engines
                  have their air temperature sensor built into the Air Flow Meter. As
                  these meters are generally removed to increase the breathing capacity
                  on a lot of engines then you would probably need to get an air temp
                  sensor from another vehicle or buy a MegaSquirt compatible sensor. So
                  yes, you can use the standard sensors but it depends on whether your
                  going to remove it. The ECU and the tuning software (MegaTune) would
                  need to be configured for the sensors. I can set up the ECU for your
                  sensors for free, but I would need 3 resistance measurements, see <a href="software/Temp_Sensor_Instructions.pdf">here</a> for more details on the measurements. I may already have done a set
                                              of sensors for your engine, please download this file <a href="inc_files/Inc_Files.zip">here</a> and check if your engine is in there. Just give me all the details when

                  It is perfectly
                  possible to run without a lambda sensor but it's not recommended unless
                  you're not worried about the efficiency of the engine as the ECU will
                  have no feedback from the exhaust so it will not be able to correct
                  the fueling. You will have to have a lambda sensor to tune it in the
                  first place unless you're going to use a Rolling Road, as these are
                  used to tell you what Air:Fuel Ratio (AFR) the engine is running at.
                  They are cheap enough to buy (around £30 for a good Bosch sensor
                  or £130ish for a Wideband) so I would fit one if you don't already
                  have one. The bung that's needed for them to screw into the exhaust
                  can be found in the scrap bin at any exhaust replacement garage and
                  they are usually given to you free. Phil<br>

                                              it is probably easier. Take a look at the Drawings section <a href="drawings.htm">here</a> to see how the ECU is connected, this should give you an insight as

I used a MegaSquirt ECU to control the fuel and ignition on that engine. But one thing is for sure, you will definetly need to control fuel and spark with an aftermarket ECU, it will not work efficiently just adding a few injectors or piggybacking your original injectors. Megasquirt will definetly control your setup very well, it is an ideal ECU for your purpose. I would think you'll need a larger set of injectors at least, it depends on what power you anticipate getting from the engine and the flow rates of your current injectors, (this can be found from the Internet). You really need to read the MS manuals here. If you decide Megasquirt is the way to go for you then you can purchase an ECU from me. Good luck with your project, Phil</p>

You should already have all the sensors needed on the engine, Air Temperature Sensor, etc. Virtually all original equipment sensors will work fine with the MS ECU. Your Zetec would have a crank sensor on it and a 36-1 trigger wheel which can be used directly with a V3.0 MS. You should also have a coil pack sat on top of the engine, this can be directly driven from this MS ECU V3.0 too, so you'll have fuel and ignition control in wasted spark mode on your setup with this MS.

                <p>Hi there, yes the MAF (Mass Airflow Meter) can be thrown away if the hardware allows it, as some setups have the MAF built into the inlet manifold. The MegaSquirt ECU's have a built in Manifold Air Pressure sensor (known as Speed Density mode) which you can use or you can use a Throttle position pot (that's what's called Alpha_n mode). It can even be adapted to use a MAF if it has a 0-5V output signal (e.g. a Ford item) so yes, the restriction of a MAF can be removed if you so desire, Phil</p>

I can't preprogram an ECU that's ready to be used without tuning. I can pre-load the ECU with settings for your engine with a base map, etc, but it will need tuning for your setup. If you can find someone on the MSExtra forum that has an engine the same as yours you may find that a lot of help, but the best thing to do is to read the manuals I've compiled and learn how to do it from scratch, its all part of the fun of it. Any good professional tuner should be able to tune your engine with an MS ECU, but you'll need to take the software (supplied on the CD) with you for the tuner to use. Phil</p>

We have an on (and on and on) going project that requires radically re jigging the Zetec engine and then running a supercharger on top. I looked at the old V2.2 MS units about 18 months ago and they looked very good value and the spec/drivers pretty impressive to say the least. If your building them can you supply the ECU only as we have full loom build facilities of our own. Thanks.</a></h4>

                <p>Hi there, I build the ECU's myself in my workshop, I'm an Electronics Engineer with over 30 years of experience. I will supply them without a wiring harness if that's how you want it. The upgrades I do are the uprated Idle Valve output (FET) so it can directly drive 3 Amps to the valve, this allows us to control Ford valves and the like in PWM mode. The original transistor simply isn't up to the job of driving an idle valve directly. I can also offer numerous spark output and input options, etc. Basically I'm selling the ECU's ready for use so the end user doesn't have to modify them, Phil</p>

Can I use it on a motorbike? I have a Honda GL1000ccm, flat four engine, 61kW@7500rpm, watercooled, waste spark ignition with two coils (so each of the two coils supplies two cylinders). But the ignition system is fine, I only need to control fuel. I can build an intake manifold as I am a good welder. Problem could be that I have no sensors on the engine, so You would have to tell me what I need to make it working (sensors, throttle plate, fuel pump, injectors, wiring diagram). I have 12V negative ground electricity. Thank You Ray</a></h4>

                <p>Ok, thats a great project. Fuel control is easy to do, well its not too bad lets put it that way. Take a look at the drawings section, there are drawings in there for you to download that would help you get a feel for what is needed. But basically you need a lambda sensor, a throttle position pot (TPS not needed if you have a plenum but you need one for ITB's), a high pressure fuel pump capable of around 50psi, 4 injectors, an air temperature sensor, a coolant sensor, fuel pressure regulator and fuel rails. I would think the easiest way would be to get them from a scrap bike with injection already fitted, Phil</p>

                <p>Hi there, we now have plug-n-play ECU's for Peugeots and several other manufactourers. They all need to be tuned for your setup, etc, I supply the software to do this with and it's not too hard to do. I have fitted MS's to a few Pug 106's and to several RV8's and Zetecs, (as well as other cars) and none of the same engined cars have the same map in it as every engine is different, the base map should help get you running but they need to be tuned for your setup. The 106 should have a suitable 60-2 wheel as standard, we can use that to feed all of the MS ECUs, Phil</p>

                  Generally if you're sensor has 3 wires then it is a hall sensor, if it has 2 wires inside a screened cable (cable with a braided casing around the outside of it under the insulation) it is likely to be a VR sensor. To check this you can turn the ignition on, ensure the sensor and original ECU, etc, is still connected as it should be, and slowly turn the engine over (remove the distributor cap so it doesn't spark) If the voltage switches from 5 or 12V to ground (0V) then you have a hall sensor. It is important to know if the voltage is 5 or 12V when it see's a tooth or if its see's a gap between the teeth.
                  If you get no voltage then re-assemble the cap and start the engine. Measure the voltage from the sensor at idle (be very very careful!!) if it reads approx 0.5Vac then you have a VR sensor. Increase the RPM to 2500 and see if the voltage increases, this means you have a VR sensor. Most VR sensors have a small round nipple in the middle on the end of the sensor where it looks at the teeth, this is the core. Hall sensors generally do not have this.
