        | All these ECU's allow you to remove the restrictive AFM (Flapper or Hotwire). An Air Temperature Sensor is supplied and needs fitting into the air intake close to the throttle plate. The MAP sensor is built into the ECU and simply needs 'T'eeing into the fuel pressure regulator reference pipe, do not use the vacuum feed for the distributor as this is a ported hole.

      p
        | To directly replace the Lucas Hotwire (14CUX) on TVR's, Morgans, Rovers, etc.
        | This ECU is a plug in replacement for the Lucas Hotwire system (14CUX) . This gives you all of the benefits of the MegaSquirt ECU, mappable fuel and ignition, without the hassle of any modifications to the main wiring harness. This is only available as a wasted spark setup, giving you distributorless ignition. The wasted spark ECU needs an ignition loom adding (supplied with the ECU) and a 36-1 wheel mounting on the crank, etc, but the basic Lucas loom is left as it was and is used to supply the throttle angle, coolant, air temp (from a new sensor), etc, to the MS ECU. This keeps your wiring as close to original as possible, so you don't lose any of the originality if that's a concern for you.

        | Fuel with EDIS8 Wasted Spark Ignition Control (Distributorless):
        br
        span.style47 £575 + £25 postage
      p
        | Unlike the 
        b RV8 PnP ECU's
        | , this needs wiring into your existing system. This setup allows you to run without the need for a distributor. The  EDIS8 module is triggered from the 36-1 crank wheel which doesn't have any drive chains and gears driving it like the distributor, so it gives a much more accurate ignition timing. The EDIS8 sends a signal to the MS ECU telling it the engine speed. The MS ECU then sends a signal back to the EDIS8 module telling it the required angle to fire the coilpacks at. The EDIS8 fires a set of four coils that are directly connected to pairs of cylinders, this means the distributor is no longer needed. It does mean you'll have to fit a 36-1 crank wheel (included in the kit) and a crank sensor (also included in the kit) but it's is easy to do, see 
        a(href='wheel_fitting.htm') here
        | . The kit is based around the
        b  Ford EDIS8
        |  system, this is a 12 pinned module which has the ignition coil drivers inside it, keeping potential noise away from the main ECU, so it's pretty immune to noise. See 
        a(href='edis.htm') here
        |  for instructions on the EDIS8. This setup will then give you mappable fuel (16x16 table) and ignition (12x12 table). Again, it can control the Lucas Idle Valve,  see 
        a(href='compare.htm') here
        |  for more of the MS-Extra features.

        | Unlike the 
        b RV8 PnP ECU's
        | , this needs wiring into your existing system. This setup is very similar to the EDIS8 kit but it doesn't use the EDIS8 module as it can directly fire the coil packs using built-in Bosch ignition drivers. I recommend fitting resistive spark plugs when using these ECU's as well as ensuring you have good engine grounds. This ECU allows you to run without the need for a distributor as the trigger to the ECU comes directly off a 36-1 crank which doesn't have any drive chains and gears driving it like the distributor, so it gives a much more accurate ignition timing. It does mean you'll have to fit a 36-1 crank wheel 
        |           (included in the kit) and a crank sensor (also included in the kit) but it's is easy to do, see 
        a(href='wheel_fitting.htm') here
        | . This setup will then give you mappable fuel (16x16 table) and ignition (12x12 table). Again, it can control the Lucas Idle Valve, see 
        a(href='compare.htm') here

        | This is the ultimate setup for any engine. It essentially runs each cylinder individually (8 injector outputs). They all share a common fuel and ignition map, but each cylinder can be trimmed individually. This allows for as near a perfect tune as possible. See 
        a(href='sequential_fuel.html') here
        |  for more on sequential fueling. This comes with a modified distributor to give the cam signal needed for a sequential fuelling system. The system has a 12x12 table for tuning the fuel firing angle to allow for air speed, etc, (load/engine speed) and a 6x6 fueling trim table which allows a + - 12.5% deviation for each injector away from the main fueling map. Again, it can control the Lucas Idle Valve, it also has launch control, switchable maps, SD card data-logging, 2 spare analogue inputs (Second Lambda, etc.) as well as 4 programmable outputs that can be used for items such as fan control, warning led, etc.
