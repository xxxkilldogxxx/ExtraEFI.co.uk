          p
            | If your engine doesn't have both temperature sensors then it is possible to use a sensor from a scrap yard. But some people like to use the original MegaSquirt sensors as the MS ECU and the tuning software is already setup for these.
          p
            | The open style air sensor is ideal for fast changing temperatures from boosted engines. The closed style is ideal for coolant and air temperature sensing in most NA setups.
