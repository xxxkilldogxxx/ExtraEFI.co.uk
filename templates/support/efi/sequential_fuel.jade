          | The cycle of a 4 stroke engine is 720deg of the crank, see above. Timing for fueling is worked out the same as ignition, in that a positive number is Before Top Dead Centre (BTDC), but only for the compression stroke. So we have can have up to +360deg (Before TDC of compression) and -360deg (After TDC Compression) As you can see in the above drawing, the ignition is usually fired just before the TDC of the compression stroke (40-10deg) i.e. a positive number!

        |         
        p
          | If we now look at the inlet opening position relative to the engine cycle for each cylinder we can see that it starts to open a little before the end of the exhaust stroke and continues to stay open for a little time in the compression stroke. Like everything there are exceptions, but this is the usual setup.
        |         
        p
          | Most engines like to have all of the fuel injected onto a shut inlet valve(s) for maximum evaporation and mixture into the air for each cylinder. So in the above case we need to have finished injecting at around -340deg, or just before then as the fuel will take a small amount of time to reach the valve. So the valve opening angle is a good starting point, but it may not be the optimum point for your engine, you will need to try all 720degs (try 5 deg steps) to figure out just where your engine performs best, you should be able to tell at idle. Simply fine tune it until you get a smooth running engine. Some people report that adjusting the angle for the richest mixture (lower AFR) is the best approach as this means more of the fuel is being burnt, therefore mixed. After getting it as rich as possible simply lean out the mixture using the VE table. It&apos;s worth saying at this point that you need a well tuned VE table before starting to play with sequential fuel, so ensure your engine is running well before starting to dive into this too deep.
        |         
        p
          | The angle that the injectors are fired can then be fine tuned (trimmed) using a table with RPM and load to allow for changes in air speed, etc. General opinion is that the fuel needs to be delivered earlier as RPM increases, due to intake air and engine speed. A rule of thumb is 40deg earlier for every increase of 1000rpm up to around 4000-5000rpm. At high RPM the PW&apos;s are usually so long that timing is no longer critical and air speed is also much higher, so any gains are minimal as rpm increases.
        |         
        p
          | Another advantage of the Semi-Full Sequential setups, is that each injector bank can be trimmed by +- 12% to fine tune the fueling from the main Fuel table. So on Semi-Seq you could tune each pair of injectors (depending on how it was wired) and on fully sequential each cylinder could be tuned to match the others. This means using EGTs or one wideband lambda / Cylinder, so its not an easy thing to do, but it is possible. For more info see the&nbsp;

The gains are not quite as much as Fully Sequential, but a smoother idle and a better throttle responce can come from tuning your engine using this method. On an even fired engine (99% of engines) pairs of pistons move up and down together (usually 1+4 - 2+3 on a 4cy). One of those pairs will be on the compression stroke and one on the exhaust stroke as they raise up the cylinder. These are the same cylinders that we pair for&nbsp;
